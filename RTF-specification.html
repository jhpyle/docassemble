<h1>
  <a name="Heading1">INTRODUCTION</a>
</h1>
<p>
The Rich Text Format (RTF) Specification is a method of encoding formatted
text and graphics for easy transfer between applications. Currently, users
depend on special translation software to move word-processing documents
between different MS-DOS®, Windows, OS/2, Macintosh, and Power Macintosh
applications.
</p><p>
The RTF Specification provides a format for text and graphics interchange
that can be used with different output devices, operating environments, and
operating systems. RTF uses the ANSI, PC-8, Macintosh, or IBM PC character
set to control the representation and formatting of a document, both on the
screen and in print. With the RTF Specification, documents created under
different operating systems and with different software applications can
be transferred between those operating systems and applications. RTF files
created in Word 6.0 (and later) for the Macintosh and Power Macintosh have
a file type of "RTF."
</p><p>
Software that takes a formatted file and turns it into an RTF file is called
a writer. An RTF writer separates the application's control information from
the actual text and writes a new file containing the text and the RTF groups
associated with that text. Software that translates an RTF file into a formatted
file is called a reader.
</p><p>
Included with the RTF specification is a sample RTF reader application (see
"Appendix A: Sample RTF Reader Application" beginning on page 89 of this
document). It is designed for use with the specification to assist those
users developing their own RTF readers. The file included with this Application
Note, Rtfreadr.exe, contains the sample RTF reader program itself. This file
and its use are described in Appendix A. The sample RTF reader is not a for-sale
product, and Microsoft does not provide technical or any other type of support
for the sample RTF reader code or the RTF specification.
</p><p>
RTF Version 1.5 has been updated to include all new control words introduced
by Microsoft Word for Windows 95 version 7.0 and Word 97 for Windows.
</p><h1>
  <a name="Heading2">RTF SYNTAX</a>
</h1>
<p>
An RTF file consists of unformatted text, control words, control symbols,
and groups. For ease of transport, a standard RTF file can consist of only
7-bit ASCII characters. (Converters that communicate with Microsoft Word
for Windows or Microsoft Word for the Macintosh should expect 8-bit characters.)
There is no set maximum line length for an RTF file.
</p><p>
A <i>control word</i> is a specially formatted command that RTF uses to mark
printer control codes and information that applications use to manage documents.
A control word cannot be longer than 32 characters. A control word takes
the following form:
</p><blockquote>
  \LetterSequence<i>&lt;</i>Delimiter<i>&gt;</i>
</blockquote>
<p>
Note that a backslash begins each control word.
</p><p>
The LetterSequence is made up of lowercase alphabetic characters between
"a" and "z" inclusive. RTF is case sensitive, and all RTF control words must
be lowercase.
</p><p>
The delimiter marks the end of an RTF control word, and can be one of the
following:
</p><p>
* A space. In this case, the space is part of the control word.
</p><p>
* A digit or a hyphen (-), which indicates that a numeric parameter follows.
The subsequent digital sequence is then delimited by a space or any character
other than a letter or a digit. The parameter can be a positive or a negative
number. The range of the values for the number is generally -32767 through
32767. However, Word tends to restrict the range to -31680 through 31680.
Word allows values in the range -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,648 for a small
number of keywords (specifically <b>\bin</b>, <b>\revdttm,</b> and some picture
properties). An RTF parser must handle an arbitrary string of digits as a
legal value for a keyword. If a numeric parameter immediately follows the
control word, this parameter becomes part of the control word. The control
word is then delimited by a space or a nonalphabetic or nonnumeric character
in the same manner as any other control word.
</p><p>
* Any character other than a letter or a digit. In this case, the delimiting
character terminates the control word but is not actually part of the control
word.
</p><p>
If a space delimits the control word, the space does not appear in the document.
Any characters following the delimiter, including spaces, will appear in
the document. For this reason, you should use spaces only where necessary;
do not use spaces merely to break up RTF code.
</p><p>
A <i>control symbol</i> consists of a backslash followed by a single,
nonalphabetic character. For example, \<b>~</b> represents a nonbreaking
space. Control symbols take no delimiters.
</p><p>
A <i>group</i> consists of text and control words or control symbols enclosed
in braces ({ }). The opening brace ({ ) indicates the start of the group
and the closing brace ( }) indicates the end of the group. Each group specifies
the text affected by the group and the different attributes of that text.
The RTF file can also include groups for fonts, styles, screen color, pictures,
footnotes, comments (annotations), headers and footers, summary information,
fields, and bookmarks, as well as document-, section-, paragraph-, and
character-formatting properties. If the font, file, style, screen-color,
revision mark, and summary-information groups and document-formatting properties
are included, they must precede the first plain-text character in the document.
These groups form the RTF file header. If the group for fonts is included,
it should precede the group for styles. If any group is not used, it can
be omitted. The groups are discussed in the following sections.
</p><p>
The control properties of certain control words (such as bold, italic, keep
together, and so on) have only two states. When such a control word has no
parameter or has a nonzero parameter, it is assumed that the control word
turns on the property. When such a control word has a parameter of 0 , it
is assumed that the control word turns off the property. For example,
\<b>b</b> turns on bold, whereas \<b>b0</b> turns off bold.
</p><p>
Certain control words, referred to as <i>destinations</i>, mark the beginning
of a collection of related text that could appear at another position, or
destination, within the document. Destinations may also be text that is used
but should not appear within the document at all. An example of a destination
is the \footnote group, where the footnote text follows the control word.
Page breaks cannot occur in destination text. Destination control words and
their following text must be enclosed in braces. No other control words or
text may appear within the destination group. Destinations added after the
RTF Specification published in the March 1987 <i>Microsoft Systems Journal</i>
may be preceded by the control symbol \<b>*</b>. This control symbol identifies
destinations whose related text should be ignored if the RTF reader does
not recognize the destination. (RTF writers should follow the convention
of using this control symbol when adding new destinations or groups.)
Destinations whose related text should be inserted into the document even
if the RTF reader does not recognize the destination should not use
\<b>*</b>. All destinations that were not included in the March 1987 revision
of the RTF Specification are shown with \<b>*</b> as part of the control
word.
</p><p>
Formatting specified within a group affects only the text within that group.
Generally, text within a group inherits the formatting of the text in the
preceding group. However, Microsoft implementations of RTF assume that the
footnote, annotation, header, and footer groups (described later in this
chapter) do not inherit the formatting of the preceding text. Therefore,
to ensure that these groups are always formatted correctly, you should set
the formatting within these groups to the default with the <b>\sectd, \pard,
</b>and <b>\plain </b>control words, and then add any desired formatting.
</p><p>
The control words, control symbols, and braces constitute control information.
All other characters in the file are plain text. Here is an example of plain
text that does not exist within a group:
</p><pre>{\rtf\ansi\deff0{\fonttbl{\f0\froman Tms Rmn;}{\f1\fdecor 
Symbol;}{\f2\fswiss Helv;}}{\colortbl;\red0\green0\blue0;
\red0\green0\blue255;\red0\green255\blue255;\red0\green255\

{\nofpages1}{\nofwords0}{\nofchars0}{\vern8351}}\widoctrl\ftnbj \sectd\linex0\endnhere \pard\plain \fs20 This is plain text.\par}
</pre>
<p>
The phrase "This is plain text" is not part of a group and is treated as
document text.
</p><p>
As previously mentioned, the backslash (\) and braces ({ }) have special
meaning in RTF. To use these characters as text, precede them with a backslash,
as in \\, \{, and \}.
</p><h1>
  <a name="Heading3">CONVENTIONS OF AN RTF READER</a>
</h1>
<p>
The reader of an RTF stream is concerned with the following:
</p><p>
* Separating control information from plain text.
</p><p>
* Acting on control information.
</p><p>
* Collecting and properly inserting text into the document, as directed by
the current group state.
</p><p>
Acting on control information is designed to be a relatively simple process.
Some control information simply contributes special characters to the plain
text stream. Other information serves to change the <i>program state</i>,
which includes properties of the document as a whole, or to change any of
a collection of <i>group states</i>, which apply to parts of the document.
</p><p>
As previously mentioned, a group state can specify the following:
</p><p>
* The <i>destination</i>, or part of the document that the plain text is
constructing.
</p><p>
* Character-formatting properties, such as bold or italic.
</p><p>
* Paragraph-formatting properties, such as justified or centered.
</p><p>
* Section-formatting properties, such as the number of columns.
</p><p>
* Table-formatting properties, which define the number of cells and dimensions
of a table row.
</p><p>
In practice, an RTF reader will evaluate each character it reads in sequence
as follows:
</p><p>
* If the character is an opening brace ({), the reader stores its current
state on the stack. If the character is a closing brace (}), the reader retrieves
the current state from the stack.
</p><p align="Justify">
* If the character is a backslash (\), the reader collects the control word
or control symbol and its parameter, if any, and looks up the control word
or control symbol in a table that maps control words to actions. It then
carries out the action prescribed in the table. (The possible actions are
discussed below.) The read pointer is left before or after a control-word
delimiter, as appropriate.
</p><p>
* If the character is anything other than an opening brace ({), closing brace
(}), or backslash (\), the reader assumes that the character is plain text
and writes the character to the current destination using the current formatting
properties.
</p><p align="Justify">
If the RTF reader cannot find a particular control word or control symbol
in the look-up table described above, the control word or control symbol
should be ignored. If a control word or control symbol is preceded by an
opening brace ({), it is part of a group. The current state should be saved
on the stack, but no state change should occur. When a closing brace (})
is encountered, the current state should be retrieved from the stack, thereby
resetting the current state. If the \<b>*</b> control symbol precedes a control
word, then it defines a destination group and was itself preceded by an opening
brace ({). The RTF reader should discard all text up to and including the
closing brace (}) that closes this group. All RTF readers must recognize
all destinations defined in the March 1987 RTF Specification. The reader
may skip past the group, but it is not allowed to simply discard the control
word. Destinations defined since March 1987 are marked with the \* control
symbol.
</p><p>
<b><i>Note</i></b><i> All RTF readers must implement the \* control symbol
so that they can read RTF files written by newer RTF writers.</i>
</p><p>
For control words or control symbols that the RTF reader can find in the
look-up table, the possible actions are as follows.

      settings will be reset to their default settings. Examples of control words
      that change destination are <b>\footnote</b>, <b>\header</b>, <b>\footer</b>,
      <b>\pict</b>, <b>\info</b>, <b>\fonttbl</b>, <b>\stylesheet</b>, and

      and not specified, then a default value will be used. The default value used
      depends on the control word. If the control word does not specify a default,
      then all RTF readers should assume a default of 0.</td>

An RTF file has the following syntax:

</p><p align="Justify">
This syntax is the standard RTF syntax; any RTF reader must be able to correctly
interpret RTF written to this syntax. It is worth mentioning again that RTF
readers do not have to use all control words, but they must be able to harmlessly
ignore unknown (or unused) control words, and they must correctly skip over
destinations marked with the <b>\*</b> control symbol. There may, however,
be RTF writers that generate RTF that does not conform to this syntax, and
as such, RTF readers should be robust enough to handle some minor variations.
Nonetheless, if an RTF writer generates RTF conforming to this specification,
then any correct RTF reader should be able to interpret it.
</p><h2>
  <a name="Heading6">Header</a>
</h2>
<p>
The header has the following syntax:
</p><p>
&lt;header&gt;
<table border="">
  <tbody><tr align="left" valign="TOP">
    <td></td>
    <td><b><i>\rtf</i></b> &lt;charset&gt; <b><i>\deff</i></b>? &lt;fonttbl&gt;
      &lt;filetbl&gt;? &lt;colortbl&gt;? &lt;stylesheet&gt;? &lt;listtables&gt;?
      &lt;revtbl&gt;?</td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>
</p><p>
Each of the various header tables should appear, if they exist, in the above
order. Document properties can occur before and between the header tables.
A property must be defined before being referenced. Specifically:
</p><p>
* The style sheet must occur before any style usage.
</p><p>
* The font table must precede any reference to a font.
</p><p>
* The <b>\deff</b> keyword must precede any text without an explicit reference
to a font, because it specifies the font to use in such cases.
</p><h3>
  <a name="Heading7">RTF Version</a>
</h3>
<p>
An entire RTF file is considered a group and must be enclosed in braces.
The \<b>rtf<i>N</i></b> control word must follow the opening brace. The numeric
parameter <b><i>N</i></b> identifies the major version of the RTF Specification
used. The RTF standard described in this Application Note, although titled
as version 1.5, continues to correspond syntactically to RTF Specification
version 1. Therefore, the numeric parameter <b><i>N</i></b> for the
\<b>rtf</b> control word should still be emitted as 1.
</p><h3>
  <a name="Heading8">Character Set</a>
</h3>
<p>
After specifying the RTF version, you must declare the character set used
in this document. The control word for the character set must precede any
plain text or any table control words. The RTF Specification currently supports
the following character sets.
<table border="">
  <tbody><tr align="left" valign="TOP">

  <a name="Heading9">Unicode RTF</a>
</h3>
<blockquote>
  Word 97 is a partially Unicode-enabled application. Text is handled using
  the 16-bit Unicode character encoding scheme. Expressing this text in RTF
  requires a new mechanism, because until this release (version 1.5), RTF has
  only handled 7-bit characters directly and 8-bit characters encoded as
  hexadecimal. The Unicode mechanism described here can be applied to any RTF
  destination or body text.
</blockquote>

  </tr>
  <tr align="left" valign="TOP">
    <td><b>\ansicpg<i>N</i></b></td>
    <td>This keyword represents the ANSI code page which is used to perform the
      Unicode to ANSI conversion when writing RTF text. <b><i>N</i></b> represents
      the code page in decimal. This is typically set to the default ANSI code
      page of the run-time environment (for example <b>\ansicpg1252</b> for U.S.
      Windows). The reader can use the same ANSI code page to convert ANSI text
      back to Unicode.
      <p>
      This keyword should be emitted in the RTF header section right after the
      <b>\ansi</b>, <b>\mac</b>, <b>\pc</b> or <b>\pca</b> keyword.</p></td>
  </tr>
  <tr align="left" valign="TOP">
    <td><b>\upr</b></td>
    <td>This keyword represents a destination with two embedded destinations,
      one represented using Unicode and the other using ANSI. This keyword operates
      in conjunction with the <b>\ud </b>keyword to provide backward compatibility.
      The general syntax is as follows:
      <pre>{\upr{keyword ansi_text}{\*\ud{keyword Unicode_text}}}
</pre>
      <p>
      Notice that this keyword-destination does not use the <b>\* </b>keyword;
      this forces the old RTF readers to pick up the ANSI representation and discard
      the Unicode one.</p></td>
  </tr>
  <tr align="left" valign="TOP">
    <td><b>\ud</b></td>
    <td>This is a destination which is represented in Unicode. The text is
      represented using a mixture of ANSI translation and use of <b>\u<i>N
      </i></b>keywords to represent characters which do not have the exact ANSI
      equivalent.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr align="left" valign="TOP">
    <td><b>\u<i>N</i> </b></td>
    <td>This keyword represents a single Unicode character which has no equivalent
      ANSI representation based on the current ANSI code page. <b><i>N</i></b>
      represents the Unicode character value expressed as a decimal number.
      <p>
      This keyword is followed immediately by equivalent character(s) in ANSI
      representation. In this way, old readers will ignore the
      <b>\u<i>N</i></b> keyword and pick up the ANSI representation properly. When
      this keyword is encountered, the reader should ignore the next
      <b><i>N</i></b> characters, where <b><i>N</i> </b>corresponds to the last
      <b>\uc<i>N</i></b> value encountered.
      </p><p>
      As with all RTF keywords, a keyword-terminating space may be present (before
      the ANSI characters) which is not counted in the characters to skip. While
      this is not likely to occur (or recommended), a <b>\bin</b> keyword, its
      argument, and the binary data that follows are considered one character for
      skipping purposes. If an RTF scope delimiter character (that is, an opening
      or closing brace) is encountered while scanning skippable data, the skippable
      data is considered to be ended before the delimiter. This makes it possible
      for a reader to perform some rudimentary error recovery. To include an RTF
      delimiter in skippable data, it must be represented using the appropriate
      control symbol (that is, escaped with a backslash,) as in plain text. Any
      RTF control word or symbol is considered a single character for the purposes
      of counting skippable characters.
      </p><p>
      An RTF writer, when it encounters a Unicode character with no corresponding
      ANSI character, should output <b>\u<i>N</i></b> followed by the best ANSI
      representation it can manage. Also, if the Unicode character translates into
      an ANSI character stream with count of bytes differing from the current Unicode
      Character Byte Count, it should emit the <b>\uc<i>N</i></b> keyword prior
      to the <b>\u<i>N</i> </b>keyword<b> </b>to notify the reader of the change.
      </p><p>
      RTF control words generally accept signed 16-bit numbers as arguments. For
      this reason, Unicode values greater than 32767 must be expressed as negative
      numbers.</p></td>
  </tr>
  <tr align="left" valign="TOP">
    <td><b>\uc<i>N</i></b></td>
    <td>This keyword represents the number of bytes corresponding to a given
      <b>\u<i>N </i></b>Unicode character. This keyword may be used at any time,
      and values are scoped like character properties. That is, a <b>\uc<i>N
      </i></b>keyword applies only to text following the keyword, and within the
      same (or deeper) nested braces. On exiting the group, the previous <b>\uc</b>
      value is restored. The reader must keep a stack of counts seen and use the
      most recent one to skip the appropriate number of characters when it encounters
      a <b>\u<i>N </i></b>keyword. When leaving an RTF group which specified a
      <b>\uc</b> value, the reader must revert to the previous value. A default
      of 1 should be assumed if no <b>\uc</b> keyword has been seen in the current
      or outer scopes.
      <p>
      A common practice is to emit no ANSI representation for Unicode characters
      within a Unicode destination context (that is, inside a <b>\ud</b> destination.).
      Typically, the destination will contain a <b>\uc0</b> control sequence. There
      is no need to reset the count on leaving the <b>\ud </b>destination as the
      scoping rules will ensure the previous value is restored.</p></td>

<h4>
  <a name="Heading10">Document Text</a>
</h4>
<p>
Document text should be emitted as ANSI characters. If there are Unicode
characters that do not have corresponding ANSI characters, they should be
output using the <b>\uc<i>N</i></b> and <b>\u<i>N</i></b> keywords.
</p><p>
For example, the text <b>Lab</b><b>[Gamma]Value</b> (Unicode characters 0x004c,
0x0061, 0x0062, 0x0393, 0x0056, 0x0061, 0x006c, 0x0075, 0x0065) should be
represented as follows (assuming a previous \<b>ucl)</b>:
</p><pre>Lab\u915Gvalue
</pre>
<h4>
  <a name="Heading11">Destination Text</a>
</h4>
<p>
Destination text is defined as any text represented in an RTF destination.
A good example is the bookmark name in the <b>\bkmkstart</b> destination.
</p><p>
Any destination containing Unicode characters should be emitted as two
destinations within a <b>\upr</b> destination to ensure that old readers
can read it properly and that no Unicode character encoding is lost when
read with a new reader.
</p><p>
For example, a bookmark name <b>Lab</b><b>[Gamma]Value</b> (Unicode characters
0x004c, 0x0061, 0x0062, 0x0393, 0x0056, 0x0061, 0x006c, 0x0075, 0x0065) should
be represented as follows:
</p><pre>{\upr{\*\bkmkstart LabGValue}{\*\ud{\*\bkmkstart Lab\u915 Value}}}
</pre>
<p>
The first sub-destination contains only ANSI characters and is the representation
that old readers will see. The second sub-destination is a <b>\*\ud
</b>destination which contains a second copy of the <b>\bkmkstart</b>
destination. This copy can contain Unicode characters and is the representation
that Unicode-aware readers must pay attention to, ignoring the ANSI-only
version.
</p><h3>
  <a name="Heading12">Font Table</a>

<p>
The \<b>fonttbl</b> control word introduces the font table group. Unique
<b>\f<i>N</i></b> control words define each font available in the document,
and are used to reference that font throughout the document. This group has
the syntax listed in the following table.

If an RTF file uses a default font, the default font number is specified
with the \<b>deff<i>N</i></b> control word, which must precede the font-table
group. The RTF writer supplies the default font number used in the creation
of the document as the numeric argument <b><i>N</i></b>. The RTF reader then
translates this number through the font table into the most similar font
available on the reader's system.

<p>
RTF supports embedded fonts with the \<b>fontemb</b> group located inside
a font definition. An embedded font can be specified by a file name, or the
actual font data may be located inside the group. If a file name is specified,
it is contained in the \<b>fontfile</b> group. The \<b>cpg</b> control word
can be used to specify the character set for the file name.

  <a name="Heading14">Code Page Support</a>

<p>
A font may have a different character set from the character set of the document.
For example, the Symbol font has the same characters in the same positions
both on the Macintosh and in Windows. RTF describes this with the \<b>cpg</b>
control word, which names the character set used by the font. In addition,
file names (used in field instructions and in embedded fonts) may not necessarily
be the same as the character set of the document; the \<b>cpg</b> control
word can change the character set for these file names as well. However,
all RTF documents must still declare a character set (that is, <b>\ansi,
\mac, \pc,</b> or <b>\pca</b>) to maintain backward compatibility with earlier
RTF readers.

  <a name="Heading16">Color Table</a>
</h3>
<p>
The \<b>colortbl</b> control word introduces the color table group, which
defines screen colors, character colors, and other color information. This
group has the following syntax:
<table border="">
  <tbody><tr align="left" valign="TOP">
    <td>&lt;colortbl&gt;</td>
    <td>'{' <b>\colortbl</b> &lt;colordef&gt;+ '}'</td>
  </tr>
  <tr align="left" valign="TOP">
    <td>&lt;colordef&gt;</td>
    <td><b><i>\red</i></b> ? &amp; <b><i>\green</i></b> ? &amp;<b><i>
      \blue</i></b> ? ';'</td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>
</p><p>
</p><p>
The following are valid control words for this group.
<table border="">
  <tbody><tr align="left" valign="TOP">
    <th colspan="1" align="left"><b>Control word </b></th>
    <th colspan="1" align="left"><b>Meaning</b></th>
  </tr>
  <tr align="left" valign="TOP">
    <td><b>\red<i>N</i></b></td>
    <td>Red index</td>
  </tr>
  <tr align="left" valign="TOP">
    <td><b>\green<i>N</i></b></td>
    <td>Green index</td>
  </tr>
  <tr align="left" valign="TOP">
    <td><b>\blue<i>N</i></b></td>
    <td>Blue index</td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>
</p><p>
</p><p>
Each definition must be delimited by a semicolon, even if the definition
is omitted. If a color definition is omitted, the RTF reader uses its default
color. The example below defines the default color table used by Word. The
first color is omitted, as shown by the semicolon following the<b> \colortbl
</b>control word. The missing definition indicates that color 0 is the `'auto''
color.
</p><pre>{\colortbl;\red0\green0\blue0;\red0\green0\blue255;\red0\green255\blue255;\red0\green255\blue0;\red255\green0\blue255;\red255\green0\blue0;\red255\green255\blue0;\red255\green255\blue255;\red0\green0\blue128;\red0\green128\blue128;\red0\green128\blue0;\red128\green0\blue128;\red128\green0\blue0;\red128\green128\blue0;\red128\green128\blue128;\red192\green192\blue192;}
</pre>
<p>
The foreground and background colors use indexes into the color table to
define a color. For more information on color setup, see your Windows
documentation.
</p><p>
The following example defines a block of text in color (where supported).
Note that the <b>cf</b>/<b>cb</b> index is the index of an entry in the color
table, which represents a red/green/blue color combination.
</p><pre>{\f1\cb1\cf2 This is colored text. The background is color

1 and the foreground is color 2.}
</pre>
<p>
If the file is translated for software that does not display color, the reader
ignores the color table group.
</p><h3>
  <a name="Heading17">Style Sheet</a>
</h3>
<p>
The \<b>stylesheet</b> control word introduces the style sheet group, which
contains definitions and descriptions of the various styles used in the document.
All styles in the document's style sheet can be included, even if not all
the styles are used. In RTF, a style is a form of shorthand used to specify
a set of character, paragraph, or section formatting.
</p><p>
The style-sheet group has the following syntax:

</p><p>
</p><p>
For &lt;style&gt;, both &lt;styledef&gt; and &lt;stylename&gt; are optional;
the default is paragraph style 0. Note for &lt;stylename&gt; that Microsoft
Word for the Macintosh interprets commas in #PCDATA as separating style synonyms.
Also, for &lt;key&gt;, the data must be exactly one character.

\fs20 This is Normal style.

\par \pard\plain \s1\qr\fs20

This is right justified. I call this style FLUSHRIGHT.

\par \pard\plain \s2\fi-720\li720\fs20\ri2880

This is an indented paragraph. I call this style IND. It produces 

a hanging indent.

\par}
</pre>
<p>
Some of the control words in this example are discussed in later sections.
In the example, note that the properties of the style were emitted following
the application of the style. This was done for two reasons: (1) to allow
RTF readers that don't support styles to still retain all formatting; and,
(2) to allow the additive model for styles, where additional property changes
are "added" on top of the defined style. Some RTF readers may not "apply"
a style upon only encountering the style number without the accompanying
formatting information because of this.
</p><h3>
  <a name="Heading18">List Table</a>
</h3>
<p>
Word 97 stores bullets and numbering information very differently from earlier
versions of Word. In Word 6.0, for example, number formatting data is stored
individually with each paragraph. In Word 97, however, all of the formatting
information is stored in a pair of document-wide list tables which act as
a style sheet, and each individual paragraph stores only an index to one
of the tables, like a style index.
</p><p>
There are two list tables in Word: the List table (destination
<b>\listtable</b>), and the List Override table (destination
<b>\listoverridetable).</b>
</p><p>
The first table Word stores is the List table. A List table is a list of
lists (destination <b>\list</b>). Each list contains a number of list properties
that pertain to the entire list, and a list of levels (destination
\<b>listlevel)</b>, each of which contains properties that pertain only to
that level.

<h4>
  <a name="Heading20">List Levels</a>

Each list consists of either one or nine list levels depending upon whether

value, the text string surrounding the number, its justification and indents,
and so on.

In addition to all of these properties, each list level can contain any character
properties (all of which affect all text for that level) and any combination
of three paragraph properties: left indents, first line left indents, and
tabs--each of which must be of a special type: <b>jclisttab</b>. These paragraph
properties will be automatically applied to any paragraph in the list.
</p><h5>
  <a name="Heading21">List Override Table</a>
</h5>
<p>
The List Override table is a list of list overrides (destination
\<b>listoverride</b>). Each list override contains the <b>listid</b> of one
of the lists in the List table, as well as a list of any properties it chooses
to override. Each paragraph will contain a list override index (keyword
<b>ls</b>) which is a 1-based index into this table. Most list overrides
don't override any properties--instead, they provide a level of indirection
to a list. There are generally two types of list overrides: (1) formatting
overrides, which allow a paragraph to be part of a list and are numbered
along with the other members of the list, but have different formatting
properties; and, (2) start-at overrides, which allow a paragraph to share
the formatting properties of a list, but have a different start-at values.
The first element in the document with each list override index takes the
start-at value that the list override specifies as its value, while each
subsequent element is assigned the number succeeding the previous element
of the list.
</p><p>
List overrides have a few top-level keywords, including a
\<b>listoverridecount</b>, which contains a count of the number of levels
whose format is overridden. This \<b>listoverridecount</b> should always
be either 1 or 9, depending upon whether the list to be overridden is simple
or multilevel. All of the actual override information is stored within a
list of list override levels (destination \<b>lfolevel</b>).

Each list override level contains flags to specify whether the formatting
or start-at values are being overridden for each level. If the format flag
(<b>listoverrideformat</b>) is given, the <b>lfolevel</b> should also contain
a list level (<b>listlevel</b>). If the start-at flag
(<b>listoverridestart</b>) is given, a start-at value must be provided. If
the start-at is overridden but the format is not, then a <b>levelstartat</b>
should be provided in the <b>lfolevel</b> itself. If both start-at and format
are overridden, put the <b>levelstartat</b> inside the <b>listlevel</b> contained
in the <b>lfolevel</b>.

These control words specify section-formatting properties, which apply to
the text <i>following</i> the control word, with the exception of the
section-break control words (those beginning with \<b>sbk</b>). Section-break
control words describe the break <i>preceding</i> the text. These control

  <a name="Heading29">Headers and Footers</a>
</h4>
<p>
Headers and footers are RTF destinations. Each section in the document can
have its own set of headers and footers. If no headers or footers are defined
for a given section, the headers and footers from the previous section (if
any) are used. Headers and footers have the following syntax:
<table border="">
  <tbody><tr align="left" valign="TOP">
    <td>&lt;hdrftr&gt;</td>
    <td>'{' &lt;hdrctl&gt; &lt;para&gt;+ '}' &lt;hdrftr&gt;?</td>

      <b>\headerf</b> | <b>\footerl</b> |<b> \footerr</b> | <b>\footerf </b></td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>
</p><p>
Note that each separate &lt;hdrftr&gt; group must have a distinct
&lt;hdrctl&gt; introducing it.

</p><p>
</p><p>
The \<b>headerl</b>, \<b>headerr</b>, \<b>footerl,</b> and \<b>footerr</b>
control words are used in conjunction with the \<b>facingp</b> control word,
and the \<b>headerf</b> and \<b>footerf</b> control words are used in conjunction
with the \<b>titlepg</b> control word. Many RTF readers will not function
correctly if the appropriate document properties are not set. In particular,
if <b>\facingp</b> is not set, then only <b>\header </b>and <b>\footer
</b>should be used; if <b>\facingp</b> is set, then only <b>\headerl</b>,
<b>\headerr</b>, <b>\footerl</b>, and <b>\footerr</b> should be used.<b>
</b>Combining both <b>\facingp </b>and <b>\titlepg</b> is allowed. You should
not use <b>\header</b> to set the headers for both pages when <b>\facingp</b>
is set. You can use <b>\headerf</b> if <b>\titlepg</b> is not set, but no
header will appear. For more information, see "Document Formatting Properties"
on page 20 and "Section Formatting Properties" on page 26 of this Application
Note. 
</p><p>
If the previous section had a first page header or footer and had
\<b>titlepg</b> set, and the current section does not, then the previous
section's first page header or footer is disabled. However, it is not destroyed;
if subsequent sections have \<b>titlepg</b> set, then the first page header
or footer is restored.
</p><h3>
  <a name="Heading30">Paragraph Text</a>
</h3>
<p>
There are two kinds of paragraphs: plain and table. A table is a collection
of paragraphs, and a table row is a continuous sequence of paragraphs partitioned
into cells. The \<b>intbl</b> paragraph-formatting control word identifies
the paragraph as part of a table. For more information, see "Table Definitions"
on page 40 of this Application Note. This control is inherited between paragraphs
that do not have paragraph properties reset with \<b>pard</b>.

  <a name="Heading31">Paragraph Formatting Properties</a>

<p>
These control words (described as &lt;parfmt&gt; in the paragraph-text syntax
description) specify generic paragraph formatting properties. These control
words can appear anywhere in the body of the paragraph, not just at the
beginning.

Note that if the <b>\pard</b> control word is not present, the current paragraph
inherits all paragraph properties defined in the previous paragraph.

To provide compatibility with existing RTF readers, all applications that
can automatically format paragraphs with bullets or numbers will also emit
the generated text as plain text in the \<b>pntext</b> group. This will allow
existing RTF readers to capture the plain text and safely ignore the autonumber
instructions. This group precedes all bulleted or numbered paragraphs, and
will contain all the text and formatting that would be auto-generated. It
should precede the '<b>{'\*\pn ... '}'</b> destination, and it is the
responsibility of RTF readers that understand the '<b>{'\*\pn ... '}'</b>
destination to ignore the \<b>pntext </b>group.

Each paragraph that is part of a list must contain some keyword to indicate
which list it's in, and which level of the list it belongs to. Word 97 also
provides the flat text representation of each number (in the \<b>listtext</b>
destination); so, RTF readers that don't understand Word 97 numbering will
get the paragraph number, along with appropriate character properties, inserted
into their document at the beginning of the paragraph. Any RTF reader that
does understand Word 97 numbering should ignore the entire \<b>listtext</b>
destination.

  <a name="Heading36">REVISION MARKS FOR PARAGRAPH NUMBERS</a>
</h5>
<p>
Paragraph numbers and ListNum fields track revision information with special
properties applied to the paragraph mark and ListNum field, respectively.
The special properties hold the "old" value of the number--the value it held
when revision-mark tracking began. At display time, Word checks the number's
current value and compares it with this "old" value to tell if it has changed.
If the numbers are different, the old value shows up as deleted and the new
value as inserted; if the numbers are the same, Word displays the new value
normally, with no revision information. If there was no old value, the new
value shows up as inserted. The following table lists the RTF specifications
for these special properties.

The following paragraph-formatting control words specify the location of
a paragraph on the page. Consecutive paragraphs with the same frame formatting
are considered part of the same frame. For two framed paragraphs to appear
at the same position on a page, they must be separated by a paragraph with
different or no frame information.

Note that if any paragraph in a table row has any of these control words
specified, then all paragraphs in the table row must have the same control
words specified, either by inheriting the properties from the previous paragraph
or by re-specifying the controls.

<h4>
  <a name="Heading40">Table Definitions</a>
</h4>
<p>
There is no RTF table group; instead, tables are specified as paragraph
properties. A table is represented as a sequence of table rows. A table row
is a continuous sequence of paragraphs partitioned into cells. The table
row begins with the \<b>trowd</b> control word and ends with the \<b>row</b>
control word. Every paragraph that is contained in a table row must have
the \<b>intbl</b> control word specified or inherited from the previous
paragraph. A cell may have more than one paragraph in it; the cell is terminated
by a cell mark (the \<b>cell</b> control word), and the row is terminated
by a row mark (the \<b>row</b> control word). Table rows can also be positioned.
In this case, every paragraph in a table row must have the same positioning
controls (see the &lt;apoctl&gt; controls on page 29 of this Application
Note). Table properties may be inherited from the previous row; therefore,
a series of table rows may be introduced by a single &lt;tbldef&gt;.
</p><p>
An RTF table row has the following syntax, as shown in the general paragraph-text
syntax shown on page 23 of this Application Note.

To read negative \<b>expnd</b> values from Word for the Macintosh, an RTF
reader should use only the low-order 6 bits of the value read. Word for the
Macintosh does not emit negative values for \<b>expnd</b>. Instead, it treats
values from 57 through 63 as -7 through -1, respectively (the low-order 6
bits of 57 through 63 are the same as -7 through -1).

  <a name="Heading44">Associated Character Properties</a>
</h4>
<p>
Bidirectional-aware text processors often need to associate a Latin (or other
left-to-right) font with an Arabic or Hebrew (or other right-to-left) font.
The association is needed to match commonly used pairs of fonts in name,
size, and other attributes. Although RTF defines a broad variety of associated
character properties, any implementation may choose not to implement a particular
associated character property and share the property between the Latin and
Arabic fonts.
</p><p>
Property association uses the following syntax:
<table border="">
  <tbody><tr align="left" valign="TOP">
    <td>&lt;atext&gt;</td>
    <td>&lt;ltrrun&gt; | &lt;rtlrun&gt;</td>
  </tr>
  <tr align="left" valign="TOP">
    <td>&lt;ltrrun&gt;</td>
    <td><b>\rtlch</b> <b><i>\af</i></b> &amp; &lt;aprops&gt;* <b>\ltrch</b>
      &lt;ptext&gt;</td>
  </tr>
  <tr align="left" valign="TOP">
    <td>&lt;rtlrun&gt;</td>
    <td><b>\ltrch</b> <b><i>\af</i></b> &amp; &lt;aprops&gt;* <b>\rtlch</b>
      &lt;ptext&gt;</td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>
</p><p>
Here are some examples of property association:
</p><pre>\ltrch\af2\ab\au\rtlch\u Sample Text
</pre>
<p>
This is a right-to-left run. Text will use the default bidirectional font,
and will be underlined. The left-to-right font associated with this run is
font 2 (in the font table) with bolding and underlining.
</p><pre>\plain\rtlch\ltrch Sample Text 
</pre>
<p>
This is a left-to-right run. The right-to-left font and the left-to-right
font use the default font (specified by \<b>deff</b>).
</p><pre>\rtlch\af5\ab\ai\ltrch\u Sample Text
</pre>
<p>
This is a left-to-right run. The right-to-left font is font 5, bold and
italicized. The left-to-right font is the default font, underlined. If the
reader does not support underlining in the associated font, both fonts will
be underlined.
</p><p>
The property association control words (described as &lt;aprops&gt; in the
syntax description) are listed in the following table. Some control words
(indicated in the following table by an asterisk following the description)
can be turned off by the control word followed by 0 .

A carriage return (character value 13) or linefeed (character value 10) will
be treated as a <b>\par</b> control if the character is preceded by a backslash.
You must include the backslash; otherwise, RTF ignores the control word.
(You may also want to insert a carriage-return/linefeed pair without backslashes
at least every 255 characters for better text transmission over communication
lines.)
</p><p>
A tab (character value 9) should be treated as a \<b>tab </b>control word.
Not all RTF readers understand this; therefore, an RTF writer should always
emit the control word for tabs.

This destination may specify one of two control words: \<b>*\bkmkstart</b>,
which indicates the start of the specified bookmark, and \<b>*\bkmkend</b>,
which indicates the end of the specified bookmark.
</p><p>
Bookmarks have the following syntax:
<table border="">

A bookmark is shown in the following example:
</p><pre>\pard\plain \fs20 Kuhn believes that science, rather than 
discovering in experience certain structured 
relationships, actually creates (or already participates in) 
a presupposed structure to which it fits the data. 
{\bkmkstart paradigm} Kuhn calls such a presupposed 
structure a paradigm.{\bkmkend paradigm}
</pre>
<p>
The bookmark start and the bookmark end are matched with the bookmark tag.
In the example, the bookmark tag is "paradigm." Each bookmark start should
have a matching bookmark end; however, the bookmark start and the bookmark
end may be in any order.
</p><p>
<b>\bkmkcolf<i>N </i></b>is used to denote the first column of a table covered
by a bookmark. If it is not included, the first column is assumed.
\<b>bkmkcoll<i>N</i></b> is used to denote the last column. If it is not
used, the last column is assumed. These controls are used within the
<b>\*\bkmkstart</b> destination following the <b>\bkmkstart</b> control.
For example, <tt>{\*\bkmkstart\bkmkcolf2\bkmkcoll5 Table1}</tt> places the
bookmark "Table1" on columns 2 through 5 of a table.

Be careful with spaces following control words when dealing with pictures
in binary format. When reading files, RTF considers the first space after
a control word the delimiter and subsequent spaces part of the document text.
Therefore, any extra spaces are attached to the picture, with unpredictable
results.
</p><p>
RTF writers should not use the carriage-return/linefeed (CR/LF) combination
to break up pictures in binary format. If they do, the CR/LF combination
is treated as literal text and considered part of the picture data.
</p><p>
The picture in hexadecimal or binary format follows the picture-destination
control words. The following example illustrates the destination format:

destinations that contain a data part and a result part. The data part is
generally hidden to the application that produced the document. A separate
application uses the data and supplies the appearance of the data. This
appearance is the result part of the object.
</p><p>
The representation of objects in RTF is designed to allow RTF readers that
don't understand objects or don't use a particular type of object to use
the current result in place of the object. This allows the appearance of
the object to be maintained through the conversion even though the object
functionality is lost. Each object comes with optional information about
the object, a required destination that contains the object data, and an
optional result that contains the current appearance of the object. This
result contains standard RTF. It is an important responsibility of the RTF
writer to provide the result so that existing RTF readers that either do
not support objects or that do not support the particular type of object
will be able to display the object.
</p><p>
When the object is an OLE embedded or linked object, the data part of the
object is the structure produced by the <b>OLESaveToStream</b> function.
Some OLE clients rely on the OLE system to render the object and a copy of
the result is not available to the RTF writer for that application. For these
cases, the object result can be extracted from the structure produced by
the <b>OLESaveToStream function. </b>For information about the
<b>OLESaveToStream </b>function, see the Microsoft Object Linking and Embedding
Software Development Kit.

<h4>
  <a name="Heading56">Drawing Object Properties</a>
</h4>
<p>
The <tt>{ \shp ............</tt> control word is followed by <tt>{
\*\shpinst</tt>
</p><p>
The bulk of a shape is defined as a series of properties. Following the <tt>{
\*\shpinst</tt> is a list of all the properties of a shape each in the following
format:
</p><pre>{ \sp  { \sn PropertyName } { \sv PropertyValueInformation } }
</pre>
<p>
</p><p>
The control word for the drawing object property is <b>\sp. </b>Each property
has a pair of name (<b>\sn</b>) and value (<b>\sv</b>) control words placed
in the shape property group. For example, the vertical flip property is
represented as:
</p><pre>{\sp{\sn fFlipV}{\sv 1}}
</pre>
<p>
</p><p>
Here, the name of the property is <b>fFlipV</b> and the value is 1, which
indicates <b>True</b>. All shape properties follow this basic format. Only
properties that have been explicitly set for a shape are written out in RTF
format. Other properties assume the default values (a property may be set
to the default value explicitly).
</p><p>
The following table describes all the names of properties for drawing objects
along with the type of their corresponding value. <a name="starthere"></a>

The format of the value depends on the property name it is paired with. Many
values are simple single numbers. Distances are expressed in EMU units. There
are 12700 EMU units in a point hence 914400 in an inch and
360000cm<sup>-1</sup>. Fractional or fixed values are expressed using units
that are 1/65536<sup>th</sup> of a whole. Angles are expressed as fractions
of a degree. Colors are 24 bit color values. Booleans have two possible values:
1 for <b>True</b> and 0 for <b>False</b>.
</p><p>
Arrays are formatted as a sequence of number separated by semicolons. The
first number tells the size of each element in the array in bytes. The number
of bytes per element may be 2, 4, or 8. When the size of the element is 8,
each element is represented as a group of two numbers. The second number
tells the number of elements in the array. For example, the points of a square
polygon are written as:
</p><pre>{sv 8;4;{0,0};{100,0};{100,100};{0,100}}
</pre>
<p>
The <b>ShapeType</b> property can have the following possible values.

The following keywords are related to defining a hyperlink hanging off of
a shape (that is, all of them are inside of a <tt>{\sp {\sn ... } {\sp
...}}</tt>). These specifically can occur in the \sp to define a property
that is a hyperlink. They are used like this:
</p><pre>{ \hl  { \hlloc  RTF-string } { \hlsrc RTF-string } { \hlfr RTF-string } }
</pre>
<p>
The three groups can be in any order. These provide the three strings needed
to describe a hyperlink fully.

  <a name="Heading57">Footnotes</a>
</h3>
<p>
The \<b>footnote</b> control word introduces a footnote. Footnotes are
destinations in RTF. A footnote is anchored to the character that immediately
precedes the footnote destination (that is, the footnote moves with the character
to which it is anchored). If automatic footnote numbering is defined, the
destination can be preceded by a footnote reference character, identified
by the control word \<b>chftn</b>. No Microsoft product supports footnotes
within headers, footers, or comments (annotations). Placing a footnote within
headers, footers, or comments (annotations) will often result in a corrupted
document.
</p><p>
Footnotes have the following syntax.
<table border="">
  <tbody><tr align="left" valign="TOP">
    <td>&lt;foot&gt;</td>
    <td>'{' <b>\footnote</b> &lt;para&gt;+ '}'</td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>
</p><p>
Here is an example of a destination containing footnotes:
</p><pre>\ftnbj\ftnrestart \sectd \linemod0\linex0\endnhere \pard\plain

It was her work in America during the Second World War, however, that forms
the basis for the paper. As others have noted, \chftn
{\footnote \pard\plain \s246 \fs20 {\up6\chftn}

this period was a turning point for Margaret Mead.}
\par
</pre>
<p>
To indicate endnotes, the following combination is emitted:
<b>\footnote\ftnalt. </b>Existing readers will ignore the <b>\ftnalt
</b>control word and treat everything as a footnote.
</p><p>
For other control words relating to footnotes, see the sections titled "Document
Formatting Properties" (page 16),<b> </b>"Section Formatting Properties"
(page 20),<b> </b>and "Special Characters" (page 38) in this Application
Note.

</p><h3>
  <a name="Heading58">Comments (Annotations)</a>
</h3>
<p>
RTF comments (annotations) have two parts; the author ID (introduced by the
control word \<b>atnid</b>) and the annotation text (introduced by the control
word \<b>annotation</b>); there is no group enclosing both parts. No Microsoft
product supports comments (annotations) within headers, footers, or footnotes.
Placing an annotation within headers, footers, or footnotes will often result
in a corrupted document. Each part of the annotation is an RTF destination.
Comments (annotations) are anchored to the character that immediately precedes
the annotation.
</p><p>
If an annotation is associated with an annotation bookmark, the following
two destination control words precede and follow the bookmark. The alphanumeric
string <b><i>N</i></b>, such as a long integer, represents the bookmark name.
<table border="">
  <tbody><tr align="left" valign="TOP">

</p><h3>
  <a name="Heading59">Fields</a>

<p>
The \<b>field</b> control word introduces a field destination, which contains
the text of fields. Fields have the following syntax:
<table border="">
  <tbody><tr align="left" valign="TOP">
    <td>&lt;field&gt;</td>
    <td>'{' <b>\field</b> &lt;fieldmod&gt;? &lt;fieldinst&gt; &lt;fieldrslt&gt;
      '}'</td>
  </tr>
  <tr align="left" valign="TOP">

    <td><b>\flddirty</b>? &amp; <b>\fldedit</b>? &amp; <b>\fldlock</b>? &amp;
      <b>\fldpriv</b>?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr align="left" valign="TOP">
    <td>&lt;fieldinst&gt;</td>
    <td>'{\*' <b>\fldinst </b>&lt;para&gt;+ &lt;fldalt&gt;? '}'</td>
  </tr>
  <tr align="left" valign="TOP">
    <td>&lt;fldalt&gt;</td>
    <td><b>\fldalt</b></td>
  </tr>
  <tr align="left" valign="TOP">

    <td>'{' <b>\fldrslt </b>&lt;para&gt;+ '}'</td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>
</p><p>
</p><p>
There are several control words that alter the interpretation of the field.
These control words are listed in the following table.
<table border="">
  <tbody><tr align="left" valign="TOP">
    <th colspan="1" align="left"><b>Control word </b></th>
    <th colspan="1" align="left"><b>Meaning</b></th>
  </tr>
  <tr align="left" valign="TOP">
    <td><b>\flddirty</b></td>
    <td>A formatting change has been made to the field result since the field
      was last updated.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr align="left" valign="TOP">
    <td><b>\fldedit</b></td>
    <td>Text has been added to, or removed from, the field result since the field
      was last updated.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr align="left" valign="TOP">
    <td><b>\fldlock</b></td>
    <td>Field is locked and cannot be updated.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr align="left" valign="TOP">
    <td><b>\fldpriv</b></td>
    <td>Result is not in a form suitable for display (for example, binary data
      used by fields whose result is a picture).</td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>
</p><p>
</p><p>
Two subdestinations are required within the \<b>field</b> destination. They
must be enclosed in braces ({ }) and begin with the following control words.
<table border="">
  <tbody><tr align="left" valign="TOP">
    <th colspan="1" align="left"><b>Control word </b></th>
    <th colspan="1" align="left"><b>Meaning</b></th>
  </tr>
  <tr align="left" valign="TOP">
    <td><b>\fldinst</b></td>
    <td>Field instructions. This is a destination control word.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr align="left" valign="TOP">
    <td><b>\fldrslt</b></td>
    <td>Most recent calculated result of the field. This is a destination control
      word.</td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>
</p><p>
</p><p>
If the instruction for a field contains a file name, then the \<b>cpg</b>
control can be used to define the character set of the file name. See "Code
Page Support" on page 9 of this Application Note for details.
</p><p>
The <b>\fldrslt </b>control word should be included even if no result has
been calculated because most readers (even those readers that do not recognize
fields) can generally include the value of the<b> \fldrslt </b>destination
in the document. A field result should not start with a table, because this
will break some RTF readers.
</p><p>
An example of some field text follows:
</p><pre>{\field {\*\fldinst AUTHOR \\*MERGEFORMAT	}{\fldrslt Joe Smith}}\par\pard
{\field{\*\fldinst time \\@ "h:mm AM/PM"}{\fldrslt 8:12 AM}}
</pre>
<p>
You can use the <b>\fldalt</b> control word to specify that the given field
reference is to an endnote. For example, the following field in RTF is a
reference to a footnote
</p><pre>{\field{\*\fldinst NOTEREF _RefNumber } {\fldrslt 1}}
</pre>
<p>
The following is an example of a reference to an endnote
</p><pre>{\field{\*\fldinst NOTEREF _RefNumber \fldalt } {\fldrslt I}}<a name="idx"></a>
</pre>
<p>
If the specified field is a form field, the <b>\*\datafield</b> destination
appears as a part of &lt;char&gt; and contains the binary data of a form
field instruction. For example:
</p><pre>{\field{\*\fldinst {\*\bkmkstart Text1} FORMTEXT
 {{\*\datafield 
00000000000000000554657874310008476565207768697a0000000000000000000000}}}
{\fldrslt Default Result}}
{\*\bkmkend Text1}
</pre>
<p>
Note that the <b>\datafield</b> destination requires the <b>\* </b>prefix.
The \<b>fldtype</b>, \<b>date</b>, \<b>time,</b> and \<b>wpeqn</b> field
keywords should be ignored.

<h3>
  <a name="Heading61">Index Entries</a>

The \<b>xe</b> control word introduces an index entry. Index entries in RTF
are destinations. An index entry has the following syntax:
<table border="">

</tbody></table>
</p><p>
</p><p>
If the text of the index entry is not formatted as hidden text with the
\<b>v</b> control word, the text is put into the document as well as into
the index. For more information on the \<b>v</b> control word, see "Character
Formatting Properties" on page 34 of this Application Note. Similarly, the
