question: A funny story
subquestion: |
  ${ person[0] } went to ${ place[0] }
  to buy
  ${ indefinite_article(noun[0]) }.

  At the ${ place[0] }, there was
  ${ indefinite_article(adjective[0])}
  ${ noun[1] }, which tried to zap
  ${ person[0] }.

  But luckily, ${ person[1] } came out
  of the back room just in time and
  lunged at the ${ noun[1] }, thereby
  saving the day.
