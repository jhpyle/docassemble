  Thank you for your thoughts.

  % if likes_fruit['Apples']:
  You like apples.
  % endif
  % if likes_fruit['Peaches']:
  You like peaches.
  % endif
  % if likes_fruit['Pears']:
  You like pears.
  % endif

  In other words, you like
  ${ likes_fruit.true_values() }.

  Your favorite, though, is ${ favorite_fruit }.

  In Python, `likes_fruit` is a `DADict`:
  `${ repr(likes_fruit) }`.
