# <a name="configfile"></a>Location of the configuration file

**docassemble** reads its configuration directives from a [YAML] file,
which by default is located in `/usr/share/docassemble/config/config.yml`.
If you are using [Docker] and [S3] or [Azure blob storage],
**docassemble** will attempt to copy the configuration file from your
[S3] bucket or [Azure blob storage] container before starting.

# <a name="edit"></a>How to edit the configuration file

The configuration file can be edited through the web application by
any user with `admin` privileges.  The editing screen is located on
the menu under "Configuration."  After the configuration [YAML] is
saved, the server is restarted.

You can also edit the configuration file directly on the file system.
(You may need to be able to do so if you make edits to the
configuration file through the web application that render the web
application inoperative.)

# <a name="sample"></a>Sample configuration file

Here is an example of what a configuration file may look like:

{% highlight yaml %}
debug: True
exitpage: https://docassemble.org

  prefix: postgresql+psycopg2://
  name: docassemble
  user: docassemble
  password: abc123

  container: yourcontainername
ec2: False
words:
  - docassemble.base:data/sources/us-words.yml
{% endhighlight %}

At a bare minimum, your configuration file should set the
[`secretkey`] and [`default sender`] directives:

{% highlight yaml %}
secretkey: 28asflwjeifwlfjsd2fejfiefw3g4o87
mail:
  default sender: '"Administrator" <no-reply@example.com>'
{% endhighlight %}

# <a name="directives"></a>Configuration directives

## <a name="debug"></a>Development vs. production

Set the `debug` directive to `True` on development servers and `False`
on production servers.  The default is `True`.

{% highlight yaml %}
debug: True
{% endhighlight %}

Setting `debug` to `True` enables the following features:

* The "Source" button in the web app, which shows the [YAML] source code used
  to generate the current question, an explanation of the path the
  interview took to get to the current question, and [readability
  statistics] for the question and the help text.
* Viewing [Markdown] source in document attachments.

This can be overridden using the [`debug` feature].

## <a name="allow demo"></a>Allowing sample interviews in production mode

By default, when `debug` is `False`, users without the privileges of
`admin` or `developer` cannot run the sample interviews in the
`docassemble.base` and `docassemble.demo` packages.  If you would like
to allow users to run these interviews, you can set `allow demo` to `True`.

{% highlight yaml %}
allow demo: True
{% endhighlight %}

## <a name="package protection"></a>Allowing developers to install the same package

By default, users with `developer` [privileges] have ownership over
the packages they directly install, and other developers cannot create
packages by the same name.  If you want to allow developers to work on
the same packages, set the `package protection` directive to `False`.

{% highlight yaml %}
package protection: False
{% endhighlight %}

## <a name="root"></a>Path to web application

Set the `root` directive if you have configured **docassemble** to run
from a sub-location on your web server.  The default is `/`.

{% highlight yaml %}
root: /da/
{% endhighlight %}

The value of `root` depends on how you configured your web server
during [installation].  If the [WSGI] application runs from the URL
`https://docassemble.example.com/da/`, set `root` to `/da/`.  Always
use a trailing slash.

If the [WSGI] application runs from the root of your web server (e.g.,
https://docassemble.example.com/), do not set this directive, or set
it to `/`.

## <a name="url root"></a>URL of application

The optional directive `url root` indicates the part of the URL that
comes before the [`root`].

{% highlight yaml %}
url root: http://example.com
{% endhighlight %}

It is normally not necessary for **docassemble** to know how it is
being accessed from the web, because the URL is provided to the web
application with every HTTP request.

However, there are some circumstances when **docassemble** code runs
outside the context of an HTTP request.  For example, if you have a
[scheduled task] that uses [`send_sms()`] to send a text message with
a media attachment, the URL for the media attachment will be unknown
unless it is set in the configuration.

## <a name="root redirect url"></a>Redirecting the root of the server

By default, if the user accesses the root URL of the server (which is
`/` unless configured differently using [`url root`]), the user is
redirected to:

* The URL indicated by `root redirect url`, if it is defined in the
  Configuration, but if it is not defined then the user is redirected
  to
* Their current interview, if they have started one, but if they have
  not started an interview already, then they are directed to
* The [`default interview`], if it is defined, but if it is not
  defined then the user is redirected to
* A list of available interviews, if [`dispatch`] is set up, but if
  not then the user is redirected to
* A factory default interview 
  (`docassemble.base:data/questions/default-interview.yml`).

If you want the user to be directed to some other URL, you can define
the `root redirect url` directive:

{% highlight yaml %}
root redirect url: https://example.com/site/intro.html
{% endhighlight %}

In this example, if the user access the root path, they will be
redirected to a web site.

The `root redirect url` can also be a relative path:

{% highlight yaml %}
root redirect url: /site/intro.html
{% endhighlight %}

This can be useful if you want to operate a static web site on the
same domain as your **docassemble** server.  To do this, you will need
to configure your web server to handle the `/site/` path, or operate
**docassemble** on a non-standard port and set up a reverse proxy that
redirects traffic to the non-standard port.

## <a name="dispatch"></a>Interview shortcuts

The `dispatch` directive allows users to start interviews with
user-friendly URLs like `https://example.com/start/legal`.

{% highlight yaml %}
dispatch:
  legal: docassemble.demo:data/questions/questions.yml
  madlibs: docassemble.base:data/questions/examples/madlibs.yml
{% endhighlight %}

In this example, the URL shortcuts `/start/legal` and `/start/madlibs`
are enabled.

In addition, when you define the [`dispatch`] directive, your users
can see a list of available interviews by going to the URL `/list` on
the site.  They will see a page like this:

![Interview list]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/interviewlist.png){: .maybe-full-width }

If you want to take advantage of the `/start/` shortcuts but you do
not want the interview listed in the interview list, set `unlisted:
True` in the [`metadata`] of the interview.

If you would like to embed the list of interviews into another web
site, you can send a [GET request] to `/list?embedded=1` to obtain a
snippet of [HTML].  For example, the [HTML] snippet might look like
this:

{% highlight html %}
<ul class="dastart">
  <li><a href="/interview?i=docassemble.demo%3Adata%2Fquestions%2Fquestions.yml">Demonstration interview</a></li>
  <li><a href="/interview?i=docassemble.base%3Adata%2Fquestions%2Fexamples%2Fmadlibs.yml">Mad libs</a></li>
</ul>
{% endhighlight %}

On your web site, you can embed this into the body of a page.  You can
use the `dastart` [CSS] class to apply styles to this list.

Here is an example of a complete page of [HTML] that demonstrates how
you can embed the result of `/list?embedded=1` into a page:

{% highlight html %}
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>Page of a web site</title>
    <style>
      ul.dastart {
        list-style-type: circle;
      }
      ul.dastart li {
        font-size: 12px;
      }
      ul.dastart a {
        text-decoration: none;
      }
      ul.dastart a:hover {
        text-decoration: underline;
      }
    </style>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
    
    <p>I thought you might be interested in some interviews.</p>
    
    <div id="interviews"></div>
    
    <p>Goodbye.</p>
    
    <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.2.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
    <script type="text/javascript">
      $.get("https://demo.docassemble.org/list?embedded=1", function(data){
        $("#interviews").html(data);
      }).fail(function(){
        $("#interviews").html('<span style="color: red">Error: unable to get list of interviews.</span>');
      });
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
{% endhighlight %}

You can [try this out here]({{ site.baseurl }}/static/test-embed.html){:target="_blank"}.

On your web site, you may need to edit files in different places in
order to control the various parts of the [HTML] response.  Some things
to note about this example:

* The place where you want the interview list to appear is designated
  by `<div id="interviews"></div>`.
* The part between `<style>` and `</style>` is optional and simply
  demonstrates how the list of interviews can be styled.  The [CSS]
  commands could also be put in a separate [CSS] file.
* The part that retrieves the interview list is the [JavaScript] call
  to [`$.get()`], which is between `<script type="text/javascript">` and
  `</script>`.  The part that plugs the [HTML] into the screen is the
  call to [`.html()`].
* [jQuery] needs to be loaded before the call to `$.get()`.  [jQuery]
  is very common on web sites, so it may already be loaded on your
  site.
* The [JavaScript] code is wrapped in a call to
  [`$( document ).ready`].  This may not be necessary on your site,
  but it can help avoid the potential problem where call to
  [`.html()`] takes place before the `<div id="interviews"></div>`
  [HTML] even exists on the screen.

You can also call `/list?json=1` to obtain a [JSON] version of the
available interviews.

## <a name="customization"></a>Customization of administrative pages

When the user is interacting with an interview, the page can be
customized with a [`features`] block.  If you want to customize the
appearance of other pages on the site, you can do so in the
Configuration using directives like `login page heading` or `profile
page title`.

The names of these directives have two parts: the first part is the
name of the page, and the second is the name of the aspect of the page
you wish to customize.

The available page names are:

* `start page`: the [start page] that shows a list of available interviews.
* `register page`: the page where the user registers for an account.
* `login page`: the page where the user logs in.
* `interview page`: the page that shows a list of saved interview sessions.
* `profile page`: the page where the user can edit his or her name.
* `change password page`: the page where users can change their password.
* `forgot password page`: the page where users can type in their
  e-mail address and receive an e-mail with a link to reset their password.
* `reset password page`: the page where users are directed when they
  forget their password.
* `404 page`: the page users see when they try to visit a URL that
  does not exist on the server.
* `main page`: the pages of interviews.  (This one is special; see below.)

The aspects of the page that can be manipulated are:

* `tab title`: the [HTML] title, which is displayed in the web browser
  tab.
* `title`: the title of the page in the navigation bar.
* `heading`: the large font heading that displays the title of the
  page in the main body of the page.
* `pre`: text that appears after the heading but before the rest of
  the content of a page.  This is empty by default.
* `submit`: text that appears before the submit buttons on a page that
  has one or more submit buttons.  This is empty by default.
* `post`: text that appears after the content of a page.  This is
  empty by default.
* `extra css`: raw [HTML] that you can insert into the `<head>` of the
  page.  This is empty by default.
* `extra javascript`: raw [HTML] that you can insert at the end of the
  `<body>` of the page.  This is empty by default.

All of the directives accept [HTML], except you will not want to use
[HTML] in the `tab title`, since it will not be displayed as [HTML].

Here are some examples of using these directives:

{% highlight yaml %}
start page title: Missouri interviews
start page heading: Interviews available to Missouri residents
interview page title: Your interviews
interview page heading: Interviews you have started
interview page extra css: |
  <link href="https://example.com/css/mystyles.css" rel="stylesheet">
login page pre: |
  <p>Unauthorized access to this site is <strong>strictly</strong>
  prohibited!</p>
register page extra javascript: |
  <script>
    console.log("We are registering.")
  </script>
{% endhighlight %}

You can also use these directives to provide different language to be
used depending on the user's language.

{% highlight yaml %}
start page title: 
  en: Available tools
  es: Herramientas disponibles
{% endhighlight %}

If you want to include the same [CSS] or [JavaScript] files in every
page of the site, including administrative pages and interview pages,
you can use the [`global css`] and [`global javascript`] directives.

<a name="main page pre"></a><a name="main page submit"></a><a
name="main page post"></a>The `main page` directive is special because
it relates to actual interviews, which are different from
administrative pages.  The only directives that work with the `main
page` prefix are `main page pre`, `main page submit`, `main page
post`.  You can use these if you want special [HTML] content to appear
on the page before the main question heading, before the buttons,
and/or after the buttons, respectively.  These values set global
defaults for the server.  They can be overridden for specific
interviews using the [`metadata`] directives [`pre`], [`submit`], and
[`post`].

<a name="start page template"></a><a name="interview page template"></a>
There are two pages that you can customize even more extensively:

* The [start page] that shows a list of available interviews.
* The list of saved interview sessions.

For these pages, you can specify an [HTML] template to use.  Use the
`start page template` and `interview page template` directives to
point to files in the "templates" directory of a package.

{% highlight yaml %}
start page template: docassemble.missouri:data/templates/my_start_page.html
interview page template: docassemble.missouri:data/templates/my_interview_page.html
{% endhighlight %}

To see what the standard templates look like, see:

* [`start.html`]
* [`interviews.html`]

You might want to use these as a starting point.  Note that
**docassemble** uses [Flask], which uses [Jinja2] HTML templates.

These templates use [Jinja2] to load a standard [HTML] framework.  If
you want, you can replace the entire body of the page using these
templates.  However, if you do so, you may wish to include 
`{% raw %}{{ extra_css }}{% endraw %}` in the `<head>` and 
`{% raw %}{{ extra_js }}{% endraw %}` at the end of the `<body>`.
On the interviews page, there is a bit of [JavaScript] that 
asks the user "are you sure?" before deleting all of the interview.
The start page does not use [JavaScript].

You can also customize these pages using [CSS].  The
[HTML] elements in the standard template use some classes do nothing;
they are just placeholders for customization.  For example, to
customize [`start.html`] and [`interviews.html`], you could include
the following in a [CSS] file that you include with [`global css`]
(which is discussed in the next section):

{% highlight css %}
h1.dastartpage {
  font-size: 15px;
}
ul.dastartpage {
  background-color: red;
}
ul.dastartpage li {
  font-weight: bold;
}
h3.dainterviewpage {
  font-decoration: underline;
}
p.dainterviewpage {
  color: #aaaaaa;
}
table.dainterviewpage td {
  border-style: solid;
  border-width: 1px;
}
{% endhighlight %}

## <a name="session list interview"></a><a name="dispatch interview"></a>Replacing built-in pages with interviews

Instead of [customizing] the start page and the interview page, you
can replace them with interviews.

{% highlight yaml %}
session list interview: docassemble.base:data/questions/examples/session-interview.yml
dispatch interview: docassemble.base:data/questions/examples/list-interview.yml
{% endhighlight %}

The [`interview_list()`] function allows you write an interview that
accesses information about the interview sessions of a logged-in user.
Here is an example interview,
`docassemble.base:data/questions/examples/session-interview.yml`,
which mimics the style of the standard list of interview sessions.

{% include side-by-side.html demo="session-interview" %}

The [`interview_menu()`] function allows you write an interview that
accesses information about the interviews available on the start page.
Here is an example interview,
`docassemble.base:data/questions/examples/list-interview.yml`, which
mimics the style of the standard start page:

{% include side-by-side.html demo="list-interview" %}

## <a name="auto resume interview"></a>Automatically resuming or starting an interview

The "My Interviews" page at `/interviews` normally displays a list of
the user's interview sessions.  By default, users are directed to
`/interviews` when they log in.

If your server only offers a single interview, for example,
`docassemble.eviction:data/questions/defend.yml`, you might not want
your users to look at a list of sessions; you might simply want them
to resume their existing session, if they have one, or start a new
session in that interview.

To accomplish this, you can set the following:

{% highlight yaml %}
auto resume interview: docassemble.eviction:data/questions/defend.yml
{% endhighlight %}

When this is set, then whenever a user logs in, the user
will be redirected to their first interview session involving the
`docassemble.eviction:data/questions/defend.yml` interview.  Or, if
they have no such session, a new session will 

If you set an `auto resume interview`, you may wish to set [`show
interviews link`] to `False` if the "My Interviews" menu is not useful
on your server.

## <a name="global css"></a><a name="global javascript"></a><a name="raw global css"></a><a name="raw global javascript"></a>CSS and Javascript customization

You can use the [`javascript` features setting] and the
[`css` features setting] to modify the [JavaScript] and [CSS] for a
particular interview.

By using `global javascript` and `global css`, you can apply
[JavaScript] and [CSS] on a more global level.  These directives allow
you to include [JavaScript] and [CSS] files in every interview and
also in the [start page] and the page showing the list of interviews.
The directive should refer to files located in the "static" directory
of a package:

{% highlight yaml %}
global css: docassemble.missouri:data/static/missouri.css
global javascript: docassemble.missouri:data/static/missouri.js
{% endhighlight %}

If you have more than one [CSS] file or more than one [JavaScript]
file, you can use these directives to refer to a list of files:

{% highlight yaml %}
global css: 
  - docassemble.missouri:data/static/missouri.css
  - docassemble.midwest:data/static/look_and_feel.css
{% endhighlight %}

You can also refer to files on the internet:

{% highlight yaml %}
global css: https://example.com/css/site_style.css
global javascript: https://example.com/js/tracker.js
{% endhighlight %}

These [JavaScript] and [CSS] files are loaded after the other
[JavaScript] and [CSS] files on the page.

Note that the [`global css`] and [`global javascript`] directives can
only refer to file names; if you want to write raw `<link>`, `<meta>`,
or `<script>` content, you can use the `raw global css` and `raw
global javascript` directives:

{% highlight yaml %}
raw global css: |
  <meta property="og:title" content="Child Custody Interview" />
raw global javascript: |
  <script>
    (function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){
    (i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o),
    m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m)
    })(window,document,'script','https://www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga');
    ga('create', 'UA-77777777-1', 'auto');
  </script>
{% endhighlight %}

## <a name="bootstrap theme"></a>Bootstrap theme

Using the `bootstrap theme` directive, you can change the look and
feel of your site's web interface by substituting a non-standard [CSS]
file in place of the standard [CSS] file used by [Bootstrap].

{% highlight yaml %}
bootstrap theme: docassemble.demo:data/static/lumen.min.css
{% endhighlight %}

You can also refer to files on the internet:

{% highlight yaml %}
bootstrap theme: https://bootswatch.com/4/minty/bootstrap.min.css
{% endhighlight %}

There are many alternative [Bootstrap] themes available on
[Bootswatch].  (Use [Bootstrap] 4 themes, not [Bootstrap] 3 themes.)
Note that you may need to use apply additional [CSS] changes in order
to get a [Bootstrap] theme to work with **docassemble**.  For example,
by default **docassemble** assumes that the navigation bar is 56
pixels in height.  But if your theme makes the navigation bar 66
pixels tall, you will need to add the following styles:

{% highlight css %}
.pad-for-navbar         { padding-top: 76px; }
.top-for-navbar         { top: 76px;         }
{% endhighlight %}

Also, some of the colors that **docassemble** uses in the navigation
bar might not work well with every theme.  You can override these
colors with [CSS] like the following:

{% highlight css %}
span.daactivetext       { color: yellow;         }
span.daactivetext:hover { color: #ffff99;        }
i.chat-active           { color: #45bf41;        }
i.chat-active:hover     { color: #55cf51;        }
i.chat-inactive         { color: #4f4f4f;        }
i.chat-inactive:hover   { color: #5f5f5f;        }
{% endhighlight %}

These styles refer to the yellow "Help" button that appears when
question-specific help is available, the green icons that appear in
the navigation bar when [live help] features are available, and the
grey color that these icons become when [live help] is no longer
available.

You can also control the [Bootstrap] theme on a per-interview basis
with the [`bootstrap theme` feature].  You can also alter [CSS] on a
per-interview basis using the [`css` features setting].

## <a name="inverse navbar"></a>Inverted Bootstrap navbar

By default, **docassemble** uses [Bootstrap]'s "dark" (formerly known
as "inverted") style of navigation bar so that the navigation bar
stands out from the white background.  If you do not want to use the
inverted navbar, set the `inverse navbar` to `False`.

{% highlight yaml %}
inverse navbar: False
{% endhighlight %}

You can also control this on a per-interview basis with the
[`inverse navbar` feature].

## <a name="button size"></a>Button size

By default, most buttons in the **docassemble** user interface are
regular size [Bootstrap] buttons.  If you want the buttons to be
"large" size, set the following in your configuration:

{% highlight yaml %}
button size: large
{% endhighlight %}

If you want the buttons to be "small" size, set the following in your configuration:

{% highlight yaml %}
button size: small
{% endhighlight %}

The default value is `medium`.

## <a name="default icons"></a>Using standard sets of icons

[Font Awesome] is enabled on all pages. **docassemble** includes the
free version (5.2.0) of [Font Awesome].  This allows you to refer to
[Font Awesome] icons using raw HTML.

In addition, **docassemble** allows you to use Google's [Material
Icons] in your raw HTML.  Since the [Material Icons] are just a font,
they are enabled by default and there is no configuration directive to
enable the use of [Material Icons].

You can also use [Font Awesome] or [Material Icons] for [decorations]
and [inline icons], without writing any raw [HTML].

By default, when you include [decorations], or you [include inline
icons], you can only refer to image files that you [have predefined].  An
inline image reference that does not have a corresponding predefined
image will appear literally (e.g., `:cow:`).  However, if you set the
`default icons` configuration directive to `font awesome`, then
references to any images that you have not predefined will be treated
as references to icons in the [Font Awesome] collection.

{% highlight yaml %}
default icons: font awesome
{% endhighlight %}

Then you can have an interview like this:

{% include side-by-side.html demo="font-awesome" %}

The "solid" style of the icons ([CSS] class `fas`) is used by default.

If you want to use icons in a different style, you can add a special
prefix to your icon reference, writing, e.g., `:far-fa-circle:`
instead of `:circle:`.  This will result in `<i class="far
fa-circle"></i>` instead of `<i class="fas fa-circle"></i>`.

To use a different [Font Awesome] style by default, set the `font
awesome prefix` directive.  For example, to use the "brand" style by
default, you can use:

{% highlight yaml %}
font awesome prefix: fab
{% endhighlight %}

Alternatively, you can use the [Material Icons] for icon references
that are not predefined image files:

{% highlight yaml %}
default icons: material icons
{% endhighlight %}

Note that when you set `default icons`, no validation is performed to
ensure that the image you reference actually exists in [Font Awesome]
or the [Material Icons].

## <a name="favicon"></a>Custom favicon in browser tab

The icon in the browser tab is known as a [favicon].  This is the icon
associated with the web application.  By default, **docassemble** uses
the **docassemble** logo for this icon.

If users "pin" your application to their device's main menu, this icon
will be used to create the resulting icon.  Microsoft, Apple, and
Google have their own conventions for doing this.

In order to "brand" your application in a custom way, create a square
logo and go to
[http://realfavicongenerator.net](http://realfavicongenerator.net) in
order to generate [favicon] files from it.  Upload a square image that
is at least 512x512 in size.  In addition to uploading your file, you
will need to make some choices about different colors that should be
used in different circumstances.  At the end, you will download a Zip
file containing a number of graphics files and other files.

Put the contents of this Zip file in a folder in a **docassemble**
package and then add a `favicon` directive to the configuration,
pointing to this folder.  For example:

{% highlight yaml %}
favicon: docassemble.abcincorporated:data/static/favicon
{% endhighlight %}

In this example, `data/static/favicon` in the
`docassemble.abcincorporated` package is a folder that is expected to
contain the following files, which were contained in the Zip file:

* `android-chrome-192x192.png`
* `android-chrome-512x512.png`
* `apple-touch-icon.png`
* `browserconfig.xml`
* `favicon-16x16.png`
* `favicon-32x32.png`
* `favicon.ico`
* `manifest.json`
* `mstile-150x150.png`
* `safari-pinned-tab.svg`

In addition to providing you with a Zip file containing the above
files, the above web site will instruct you to place particular
`<link>` and `<meta>` tags in the HTML of your site.  **docassemble**
does this for you automatically, so you can ignore most of this.
However, two of the lines are important.  The will look like this:

{% highlight html %}
<link rel="mask-icon" href="/safari-pinned-tab.svg" color="#698aa7">
<meta name="theme-color" content="#83b3dd">
{% endhighlight %}

Note the `color` in the first line and the `content` in the second
line.  Then add the following two lines to your configuration,
corresponding to the above two lines:

{% highlight yaml %}
favicon mask color: #698aa7
favicon theme color: #83b3dd
{% endhighlight %}

If you do not specify `favicon mask color` or `favicon theme color`,
your custom [favicon] will still work, but **docassemble** will choose
colors for you.  (The colors above are the defaults.)

If any of the above files is missing, your [favicon] will probably
still work in most circumstances.  The most important file is
`favicon.ico`, a special graphics file in Microsoft's [ICO] format.

Note that if you have set the [`root`] directive (if your
**docassemble** site at `https://example.com/something/` instead of
`https://example.com/`), you will need to account for this when you
generate the [favicon] files using the above web site.  This is
important because the `manifest.json` and `browserconfig.xml` files
contain URL references.  If your site is at `/something/`, then
`manifest.json` will need to refer to
`"/something/android-chrome-192x192.png"` instead of
`"/android-chrome-192x192.png"`.

Note that most web browsers will store a cache of the [Favicon], so
that when you make a change to your app's [Favicon], it may seem that
your change is not working when it actually is.  If it seems that your
[Favicon] has not taken effect, try accessing the app a web browser
that you do not normally use.

## <a name="icon size"></a>Icon size

The size of icons in [decorations] and in [image buttons] is not
specified in [CSS].  To change these sizes, you can edit these
configuration directives:

{% highlight yaml %}
decoration size: 2.0
decoration units: em
button icon size: 4.0
button icon units: em
{% endhighlight %}

## <a name="exitpage"></a>Exit page

The `exitpage` directive contains the default URL to which the user
should be directed after clicking a button that runs an [`exit`] or
[`leave`] command.  (See the [Setting Variables] section.)

For example:

{% highlight yaml %}
exitpage: http://example.com/pages/thankyou.html
{% endhighlight %}

## <a name="db"></a>SQL database

The `db` section of the configuration tells the **docassemble** web
app where to find the SQL database in which to store users' answers,
login information, and other information.

{% highlight yaml %}
db:
  prefix: postgresql+psycopg2://
  name: docassemble
  user: docassemble
  password: abc123
  host: localhost
  port: 5432
  table prefix: Null
{% endhighlight %}

The `prefix` is a [SQLAlchemy] prefix.  If you use a database other
than [PostgreSQL], change this.  For [MySQL], use `mysql://`

<a name="db host"></a>**docassemble** will connect to the SQL database
at the hostname `host` on the port `port`, and will authenticate with
the `user` and `password`.  It will connect to the database called
`name`.  If you want separate **docassemble** systems to share the
same database, you can set a `table prefix`.

## <a name="appname"></a><a name="brandname"></a>Branding

The `appname` and `brandname` directives control the name of the
application in various contexts.

{% highlight yaml %}
appname: Legal Helper
brandname: Legal Helper Application
{% endhighlight %}

On administration pages, the `appname` appears in the web browser tab,
and the `brandname` appears in the navigation bar.

The `appname` is also used in e-mails that are generated by the
[user login system].

The `appname` defaults to `docassemble`.  The `brandname` will default
to the `appname` if `brandname` is not specified.

## <a name="default title"></a><a name="default short title"></a>Default name in navigation bar

The `default title` and `default short title` directives control the
names that are displayed in the web browser tab and the navigation bar
of interviews that do not specify these titles in their [`metadata`].

The "short" title appears on mobile devices, while the long title
appears on larger screens.

{% highlight yaml %}
default title: Abramsom Baker and Calloway, LLP
default short title: ABC LLP
{% endhighlight %}

If not specified, the `default title` will default to the
[`brandname`].

## <a name="uploads"></a>Uploads directory

The `uploads` directive indicates the directory in which uploaded files are stored.

{% highlight yaml %}
uploads: /netmount/files/docassemble/uploads
{% endhighlight %}

If you are using a [multi-server arrangement] and not using [S3] or
[Azure blob storage], this needs to point to a central network drive.

The default value is `/usr/share/docassemble/files`.

## <a name="packages"></a>Python directory

The `packages` directive indicates the base directory into which
**docassemble** extension packages will be installed.  The
[PYTHONUSERBASE] environment variable is set to this value and [pip]
is called with `--install-option=--user`.  When [Python] looks for
packages, it will look here.  [Python]'s default value is `~/.local`,
but **docassemble** changes it to the value of this directive, or
`/usr/share/docassemble/local` if the directive is not defined.

{% highlight yaml %}
packages: /netmount/files/docassemble/local
{% endhighlight %}

If you are using a [multi-server arrangement] and not using [S3] or
[Azure blob storage], this needs to point to a central network drive.

## <a name="webapp"></a>Path to WSGI application

The `webapp` directive indicates the path to the [WSGI] file loaded by
the web server.

{% highlight yaml %}
webapp: /netmount/files/docassemble/webapp/docassemble.wsgi
{% endhighlight %}

**docassemble** needs to know this filename because the server needs
to reset itself after an add-on package is updated.  The web server is
reset by updating the modification time of the [WSGI] file.

The default value is `/usr/share/docassemble/webapp/docassemble.wsgi`.

## <a name="certs"></a>Path to SSL certificates

The `certs` directive indicates a central location where SSL
certificates for the web server can be found.  The location can be a
file path, an [S3] path, or an [Azure blob storage] path.  This is
only relevant if you are using [HTTPS].

For example, you might keep your certificates on a network drive:

{% highlight yaml %}
certs: /netmount/files/docassemble/certs
{% endhighlight %}

By default, the [Apache] HTTPS configuration contains:

{% highlight text %}
SSLCertificateFile /etc/ssl/docassemble/apache.crt
SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/ssl/docassemble/apache.key 
SSLCertificateChainFile /etc/ssl/docassemble/apache.ca.pem
{% endhighlight %}

When using a [multi-server arrangement] or [Docker], the [supervisor]
process on each web server executes the
[`docassemble.webapp.install_certs`] module during the
[startup process].  This module copies certificates from the location
indicated by `certs` to `/etc/ssl/docassemble` before starting the web
server.  This is a convenience feature.  Otherwise, you would have to
manually install the SSL certificates on every new **docassemble** web
server you create.

The value of `certs` can be a file path, an [Amazon S3]<span></span>
[URI] (e.g., `s3://exampledotcom/certs`), or an
[Azure blob storage]<span></span> [URI] (e.g.,
`blob://youraccountname/yourcontainername/certs`).  The contents of
the directory are copied to `/etc/ssl/docassemble`.

If you leave the `certs` setting undefined (which is recommended),
**docassemble** will look in `/usr/share/docassemble/certs` if the
[`s3`] and [`azure`] settings are not enabled.

If [`s3`] is enabled, it will look for [S3] keys with the prefix
`certs/` in the `bucket` defined in the [`s3`] configuration.

If [`azure`] is enabled, it will look for [Azure blob storage] objects
with the prefix `certs/` in the `container` defined in the [`azure`]
configuration.

Here is an example.  Install [`s3cmd`] if you have not done so already:

{% highlight bash %}
apt-get install s3cmd
{% endhighlight %}

Then do:

{% highlight bash %}
s3cmd --access_key=YOURACCESSKEY --secret_key=YOURSECRETKEY put yourserver.crt s3://yourbucket/certs/apache.crt
s3cmd --access_key=YOURACCESSKEY --secret_key=YOURSECRETKEY put yourserver.key s3://yourbucket/certs/apache.key
s3cmd --access_key=YOURACCESSKEY --secret_key=YOURSECRETKEY put yourserver.ca.pem s3://yourbucket/certs/apache.ca.pem
{% endhighlight %}

If your [`s3`] configuration has `bucket: yourbucket`, then you do not
need to set a `certs` configuration, because **docassemble** will by
default look in `s3://yourbucket/certs`.  However, if the certificates
are stored in another location, you can specify a different location:

{% highlight yaml %}
certs: s3://otherbucket/certificates
{% endhighlight %}

If you want to use a location other than `/etc/ssl/docassemble`, you
can change the [`cert install directory`] setting (see below).  You will
also, of course, need to change the web server configuration file.

## <a name="mail"></a>E-mail configuration

**docassemble** needs to send e-mail, for example to reset people's
passwords, or to let users of a multi-user interview know that it is
their turn to start answering questions.

By default, **docassemble** assumes that an [SMTP] server is installed
on the same machine as the web server and that it uses port 25.

<a name="default sender"></a>If you are going to send mail, you should
at least set the `default sender` directive, which sets the return
address on any e-mails generated from **docassemble**:

{% highlight yaml %}
mail:
  default sender: '"Administrator" <no-reply@example.com>'
{% endhighlight %}

The default set-up of a local [SMTP] server will probably not be
appropriate for your situation, as most internet service providers
block outgoing e-mail.

### <a name="smtp"></a>Using an external [SMTP] server

To use another [SMTP] server as the mail server, do something like:

{% highlight yaml %}
mail:
  default sender: '"Administrator" <no-reply@example.com>'
  username: mailuser
  password: abc123
  server: smtp.example.com
  port: 25
  use ssl: False
  use tls: True
{% endhighlight %}

If you are hosting **docassemble** in the cloud, you will probably
have to use a separate [SMTP] server in order to send e-mail.

A free option is [Mailgun].  You can sign up with [Mailgun], provide a
credit card (which will only be charged if you exceed the free tier),
configure some [DNS] entries, and then set your configuration to
something like this:

{% highlight yaml %}
mail:
  default sender: '"Example, Inc." <no-reply@mg.example.com>'
  username: 'postmaster@mg.example.com'
  password: '5a4a0c5f3da35f3bc10f0462364c26dd'
  server: 'smtp.mailgun.org'
{% endhighlight %}

### <a name="mailgun api"></a>Using the Mailgun API

Another way to send e-mail using [Mailgun] is through its API.  If you
use the API, mail is sent to [Mailgun] using [HTTP], rather than
[SMTP].  This may be more reliable than [SMTP], since internet service
providers may slow down or block [SMTP] traffic as a way of protecting
against spam.

To use this method, obtain an API key from [Mailgun] and set it as the
`mailgun api key`.  Also set your [Mailgun] domain as the `mailgun
domain`.

{% highlight yaml %}
mail:
  default sender: '"Example, Inc." <no-reply@mg.example.com>'
  mailgun api key: key-b21b28f6e29be1f463478238d172813e
  mailgun domain: mg.example.com
{% endhighlight %}

## <a name="default interview"></a>Default interview

If no [interview] is specified in the URL when the web browser first
connects to the **docassemble** server, the interview indicated by
`default interview` will be used.  The interview needs to be specified
in "package name:relative file path" format.  For example:

{% highlight yaml %}
default interview: docassemble.base:data/questions/examples/attachment.yml
{% endhighlight %}

If this directive is not set, **docassemble** will redirect to a page
showing a [list of available interviews] determined by the
[`dispatch`] directive.  However, if the [`dispatch`] directive is not
defined, users will be directed to the demonstration interview,
`docassemble.base:data/questions/default-interview.yml`.

## <a name="flask log"></a><a name="celery flask log"></a>Flask log file location

**docassemble** uses the [Flask] web framework.  The `flask log` and
`celery flask log` directives contain the paths to the [Flask] log
files for the web application and the [Celery] background workers,
respectively.  Most errors write to the `docassemble.log` file located
in `/usr/share/docassemble/log` (or the directory indicated by
[`log`], or to standard web server error logs, but there are some
errors, typically those that are [Flask]-related, that will only write
to these log files.

{% highlight yaml %}
flask log: /tmp/docassemble-log/flask.log
celery flask log: /tmp/docassemble-log/celery-flask.log
{% endhighlight %}

The default locates for the [Flask] log files are `/tmp/flask.log` and
`/tmp/celery-flask.log`.

## <a name="language"></a><a name="dialect"></a><a name="locale"></a>Default language, locale, and dialect

These directives set the default [language and locale settings] for
**docassemble** interviews.

{% highlight yaml %}
language: en
locale: en_US.utf8
dialect: us
{% endhighlight %}

The `language` needs to be a lowercase [ISO-639-1] code.  The `locale`
needs to be a locale name that will be accepted by the [locale]
library.

The dialect is only relevant for the text-to-speech feature, which is
controlled by the [special variable `speak_text`].  See the
[`voicerss`] configuration for more information about configuring this
feature.  The default dialect is only used as a fallback, in case the
dialect cannot be determined any other way.  It is better to set the
dialect using [`set_language()`] or the [`voicerss`] configuration.

## <a name="country"></a>Default country

The `country` directive sets the default country for **docassemble**.

{% highlight yaml %}
country: US
{% endhighlight %}

The country is primarily relevant for interpreting telephone numbers.
The code needs to be a valid country code accepted by the
[phonenumbers] library.

## <a name="os locale"></a>Operating system locale

If you are using [Docker], the `os locale` directive will set the
default operating system locale.

{% highlight yaml %}
os locale: en_US.UTF-8 UTF-8
{% endhighlight %}

## <a name="other os locales"></a>Other available locales

If your interviews use locale and language settings that your
operating system does not support, you will get an error.

On [Docker], you can enable locales other than the [`os locale`] in
the operating system by providing a list of locales to the `other os
locales` directive:

{% highlight yaml %}
other os locales:
  - en_GB.UTF-8 UTF-8
  - es_MX.UTF-8 UTF-8
{% endhighlight %}

## <a name="server administrator email"></a>E-mail address of server administrator
   
On [Docker], you can provide an e-mail address to the [Apache] web
server, so that if your server has an error, users are told an
appropriate e-mail address to contact.

{% highlight yaml %}
server administrator email: support@example.com
{% endhighlight %}

This e-mail address will be used to set the [`ServerAdmin`] directive
in the [Apache] configuration.

## <a name="error notification email"></a>E-mail address to which error messages shall be sent

If `error notification email` is set to an e-mail address, then if any
user sees an error message, the server will try to send an e-mail
notification to this e-mail address.  If possible, the e-mail will
contain the error message.

Information about errors is also available in the [Logs].

## <a name="error notification variables"></a>Whether to include interview variables in error notification

If `error notification variables` is set to true, then when an error
notification e-mail is sent, the interview variables will be attached
as a JSON file.

The default value is the value of [`debug`]; that is, the variables
will be included if the server is a development server, but not
included if the server is a production server.

Putting the interviews variables into a file and e-mailing them lowers
security, especially when server-side encryption is being used.

{% highlight yaml %}
error notification variables: True
{% endhighlight %}

In the case of some errors, obtaining the interview variables is not
possible; in that case, the variables will not be attached.

## <a name="error help"></a>Help text to display when there is an error

When an error happens, the user will see the error message on the
screen, which can be confusing.  You can add some additional content
to this screen so that the user sees something other than the error
message:

{% highlight yaml %}
error help: |
  We are sorry, our computer has malfunctioned.  Please call
  202-555-1515 for assistance, or visit our [web site](https://example.com).
{% endhighlight %}

The format of the `error help` is [Markdown].

You can also set this on a per-interview basis using [`error help`]
inside the [`metadata`].

## <a name="debian packages"></a>Debian packages to install

On [Docker], you can ensure that particular [Debian] packages are
installed by providing a list of packages to the `debian packages`
directive:

{% highlight yaml %}
debian packages:
  - r-base
  - r-cran-effects
{% endhighlight %}

These packages will be installed when the [Docker] container starts.

## <a name="default admin account"></a>Default administrator account credentials

When a **docassemble** SQL database is first initialized, an
administrative user is created.  By default, this user has the e-mail
address `admin@admin.com` and the password `password`.  As soon as the
web server comes on-line, you can log in and change the e-mail address
and password to something more secure.

However, you can also use the `default admin account` directive in the
configuration so that a more secure e-mail address and password are
used during the setup process.

{% highlight yaml %}
default admin account:
  email: admin@example.com
  password: 67Gh_Secret_2jx
{% endhighlight %}

The settings are only used by the [`docassemble.webapp.create_tables`]
module during the initial setup process.  Using the information
defined here, that script sets up a single account in the
[user login system] with "admin" privileges.

After [`create_tables`] runs for the first time, you can delete the
`default admin account` information from the configuration file.

## <a name="use alembic"></a>Database table upgrades

By default, **docassemble** uses [alembic] to upgrade the SQL database
from one version to another.  To turn this off, you can add:

{% highlight yaml %}
use alembic: False
{% endhighlight %}

## <a name="secretkey"></a>Secret key for Flask

The [Flask] web framework needs a secret key in order to manage
session information and provide [protection] against
[cross-site request forgery].  Set the `secretkey` to a random value
that cannot be guessed.

{% highlight yaml %}
secretkey: CnFUCzajSgjVZKD1xFfMQdFW8o9JxnBL
{% endhighlight %}

The [startup process] on [Docker] sets the `secretkey` to a random
value.

## <a name="password secretkey"></a>Secret key for passwords

The `password secretkey` is used in the process of encrypting
interview answers for users who log in using
[Facebook, Twitter, Google, or Azure].  It defaults to the same value as
`secretkey`.  If this value changes, users who log in through
Facebook, Twitter, Google or Azure will not be able to resume stored
interviews.

## <a name="require referer"></a>Allowing referer blocking

By default, when HTTPS is used, **docassemble** uses a form of
[CSRF protection] that checks whether the [referer header] matches the
host.  For privacy reasons, some users set their browsers to disable
the sending of the referer header.  If the [referer header] is
missing, the [CSRF protection] mechanism will generate an error.  To
bypass this security feature, set:

{% highlight yaml %}
require referer: False
{% endhighlight %}

The default setting is `True`.

## <a name="png resolution"></a><a name="png screen resolution"></a>Image conversion resolution

When users supply PDF files and **docassemble** includes those files
within a [document], the PDF pages are converted to PNG images in
order to be included within RTF files.  The `png resolution` directive
defines the dots per inch to be used during this conversion.

PDF files are also converted to PNG for previewing within the web app,
but at a lower resolution.  The `png screen resolution` directive
defines the dots per inch to be used for conversion of PDF pages to
PNG files for display in the web browser.

<a name="ocr dpi"></a>OCR resolution

If you use the [`ocr_file()`] function, the pages of the PDF file will
be converted to images before being read by the OCR engine.  By
default, the resolution used is 300 dpi.  To change this to something
else, set the `ocr dpi` directive:

{% highlight yaml %}
ocr dpi: 500
{% endhighlight %}

## <a name="retype password"></a>Controlling whether registering users need to retype their passwords

By default, users when registering must type in their passwords twice.
To allow users to register after only typing the password once, you
can set the `retype password` directive to `False`.

{% highlight yaml %}
retype password: False
{% endhighlight %}

## <a name="enable remember me"></a>Controlling whether the "remember me" feature is available

By default, users can click the "Remember me" checkbox when they log
in, so that they do not have to log in when they come back to the
site.  To disable this feature, set `enable remember me` to `False`.

{% highlight yaml %}
enable remember me: False
{% endhighlight %}

## <a name="password complexity"></a>Controlling password complexity

By default, users when registering must select a password that is at
least six characters long and that contains at least one lower case
letter, at least one upper case letter, and at least one digit
character.  You can alter these requirements using the `password
complexity` directive.

{% highlight yaml %}
password complexity:
  length: 8
  uppercase: 0
  lowercase: 1
  digits: 2
  punctuation: 1
{% endhighlight %}

In this example, passwords must be eight characters in length, must
contain at least one lower case character, must contain at least two
digit characters, and must contain at least one punctuation character.

If you leave out any one of these directives, the default value for
that setting will be used.

Changing the `password complexity` directive has no effect on users
who have already set their passwords.

If a user tries to set a password that does not meet the password
complexity requirements, an error message will be displayed that
describes what the password complexity requirements are.  You can
manually override this error message by setting the `error message`
directive within the `password complexity` directive to what you want
the error message to be.

## <a name="show login"></a>Hiding the login link

If the `show login` directive is set to `False`, users will not see a
"Sign in or sign up to save answers" link in the upper-right-hand
corner of the web app.

{% highlight yaml %}
show login: False
{% endhighlight %}

The default behavior is to show the "Sign in or sign up to save
answers" link.  If `show login` is `False`, users will see an "Exit"
option.  The appearance and behavior of the "Exit" option is
configurable in the interview [`metadata`] using the directives [`exit
link`] and [`exit label`].  There is also a [`show login` metadata
directive] that contols this feature on a per-interview basis.

## <a name="show profile link"></a>Hiding the profile link

If the `show profile link` directive is set to `False`, logged-in
users will not see a "Profile" link in the web app menu.  Instead,
they will see a "Change Password" link.

{% highlight yaml %}
show profile link: False
{% endhighlight %}

Note that users with `admin` privileges will always see the "Profile"
link.

## <a name="show interviews link"></a>Hiding the "my interviews" link

If the `show interviews link` directive is set to `False`, logged-in
users will not see a "My Interviews" link in the web app menu.

{% highlight yaml %}
show interviews link: False
{% endhighlight %}

Note that users with `admin` privileges will always see the "My
Interviews" link.

## <a name="show dispatch link"></a>Showing the "available interviews" link

If the `show dispatch link` directive is set to `True`, and you have
configured the [`dispatch`] directive, then logged-in users will see
an "Available Interviews" link in the web app menu, which will direct
them to the `/list` page of your site.

{% highlight yaml %}
show dispatch link: True
{% endhighlight %}

By default, this is not shown in the web app menu.

## <a name="allow registration"></a>Invitation-only registration

If the `allow registration` directive is set to `False`, users will
not be allowed to register to become users of the site unless they are
[invited by an administrator].

{% highlight yaml %}
allow registration: False
{% endhighlight %}

The default behavior is to allow any user to register.

## <a name="email confirmation"></a>E-mail confirmation

If you want to verify e-mail addresses of users, you can set the
`email confirmation privileges` directive to a list of [privileges] for which
e-mail confirmation should be a requirement of logging in.

{% highlight yaml %}
email confirmation privileges:
  - admin
  - developer
  - advocate
{% endhighlight %}

By default, e-mail confirmation is not required for any privileges (i.e.,
the `email confirmation privileges` is an empty list.  Also, the default
administrative user is confirmed when initially created, so you will
never need to confirm that user's e-mail.

Before you enable this feature, make sure you have a working
[email configuration](#mail).

## <a name="ldap login"></a>LDAP login

If you want to connect the **docassemble** login system to a local [LDAP]
([Active Directory]) server, add an `ldap login` section to the
Configuration.

At a minimum, the following directives must be set:

{% highlight yaml %}
ldap login:
  enable: True
  server: 192.168.1.124
{% endhighlight %}

If `ldap login` is enabled, then when a user tries to log in, the
user's e-mail address and password will be checked against the [LDAP]
server.  If authentication succeeds, **docassemble** will check to see
if a user with that e-mail address already exists in the
**docassemble** login system.  If so, the user will be logged in as
that user.  If the user does not already exist, then a user with that
e-mail address will be created in the **docassemble** login system and
will be logged in as that user.

If the password does not authenticate, then the login process will
proceed as normal; if a user already exists in the **docassemble**
login system with that username and password, the user will be logged
in as that user.

Thus, the [LDAP] login system can coexist with the standard
**docassemble** login system.

You can also set the `base dn`, `bind email`, and `bind password`
directives:

{% highlight yaml %}
ldap login:
  enable: True
  server: 192.168.1.124
  base dn: "ou=users,dc=example,dc=com"
  bind email: "jsmith@example.com"
  bind password: "xxsecretxx"
{% endhighlight %}

If these additional directives are set, then when a user tries to
register on the **docassemble** system, an error message will be
generated if the e-mail address exists on the [LDAP] server.  The
`bind email` and `bind password` are necessary so that **docassemble**
can connect to the [LDAP] server and run a search for the e-mail
address in question.  When it does so, it searches within the `base
dn` for an entry with the attribute `mail`.  If one or more entries
are found, the error message is raised.  If your server uses a
different attribute for the e-mail address, you can set the directive
`search pattern` under `ldap login`.  By default, `search pattern` is
set to `mail=%s`.  (The `%s` is replaced with the e-mail address when
the search is run.)

You may wish to [disable registration] entirely when using `ldap
login`.  In that case, it is not necessary to set the `base dn`, `bind
email`, and `bind password` directives.

## <a name="xsendfile"></a>Support for xsendfile

If your web server is not configured to support X-SENDFILE headers,
set the `xsendfile` directive to `False`.

{% highlight yaml %}
xsendfile: False
{% endhighlight %}

Use of X-SENDFILE is recommended because it allows the web server,
rather than the Python [WSGI] server, to serve files.  This is
particularly useful when serving sound files, since the web browser
typically asks for only a range of bytes from the sound file at a
time, and the [WSGI] server does not support the HTTP Range header.

## <a name="log"></a>Directory for log files

**docassemble** writes messages to a log files stored in the directory
indicated by the `log` directive.  These messages are helpful for
debugging problems with interviews.

{% highlight yaml %}
log: /tmp/docassemble-log
{% endhighlight %}

The default directory is `/usr/share/docassemble/log`.

If a `log server` is set, **docassemble** will write messages to TCP
port 514 on that server, and will not write to the `log` directory.

## <a name="interview delete days"></a>Days of inactivity before interview deletion

When the [scheduled tasks] feature is [enabled] on the server,
**docassemble** will delete interviews after 90 days of inactivity.
To change the number of days, set the `interview delete days`
directive in the configuration.  For example:

{% highlight yaml %}
interview delete days: 180
{% endhighlight %}

If `interview delete days` is set to `0`, interviews will never be
deleted through [scheduled tasks].

## <a name="checkin interval"></a>Polling frequency

By default, the user interface polls the server every six seconds to
"check in" to see if anything has happened that it needs to know
about, and to let the server know that the user is still active.

You can change this interval by setting the `checkin interval`
directive.  The number refers to the milliseconds between each call to
the server.

{% highlight yaml %}
checkin interval: 6000
{% endhighlight %}

If you set the `checkin interval` to `0`, this will turn off the
check-in mechanism altogether.  This might be useful if you do not
need the check-in feature and you want to prevent unnecessary traffic
and CPU usage.

The features that rely on the `checkin interval` being greater than
zero include:

- Notifications of the results of [background tasks].
- The [check in] feature.
- The [live help] features.

Other than setting `checkin interval` to `0`, it is probably not a
good idea to reduce this value below `6000`.  If requests to modify a
single interview come in too frequently, problems can occur.

## <a name="docassemble git url"></a>Alternative GitHub location for docassemble

The [Packages] feature updates the **docassemble** software directly
from [GitHub].  If you need to change the location of this repository
to your own [fork] of **docassemble**, you can add this directive.

{% highlight yaml %}
docassemble git url: https://github.com/yourusername/docassemble
{% endhighlight %}

The default value is `'{{ site.github.repository_url }}'`.

This directive only has an effect during [initial database setup].

## Pre-defined variables for all interviews

If you would like to pass variable definitions from the configuration
into the interviews, you can set values of the `initial dict`:

{% highlight yaml %}
initial dict:
  host_company: Example, Inc.
  host_url: http://example.com
{% endhighlight %}

Then, in all of the interviews running on the server, you can include
things like:

{% highlight yaml %}
---
sets: splash_screen
question: Welcome to the interview.
subquestion: |
  Web hosting has been graciously provided by ${ host_company }.
---
{% endhighlight %}

## <a name="words"></a>Translations of words and phrases

If your server will offer interviews in languages other than English,
you will want to make sure that built-in words and phrases used within
**docassemble**, such as "Continue" and "Sign in," are translated into
the user's language.

The `words` directive loads one or more [YAML] files in order:

{% highlight yaml %}
words:
  - docassemble.base:data/sources/us-words.yml
{% endhighlight %}

Each [YAML] file listed under `words` must be in the form of a
dictionary in which the keys are languages ([ISO-639-1] codes) and the
values are dictionaries with the translations of words or phrases.

Assuming the following is the content of the
`data/sources/words.yml` file in [`docassemble.base`]:

{% highlight yaml %}
es:
  Continue: Continuar
  Help: ¡Ayuda!
{% endhighlight %}

then if the interview calls `set_language('es')` (Spanish) and
**docassemble** code subsequently calls `word('Help')`, the result
will be `¡Ayuda!`.

When you are logged in as a developer or administrator, you can go to
the "Utilities" page from the main menu, where you will find a utility
for generating a draft [YAML] file for translating all of the words
and phrases that **docassemble** uses and that might be presented to
the user.  If you have set up a [Google API key](#google), it will use
the [Google Cloud Translation API] to prepare "first draft"
translations for any [ISO-639-1] language you designate.

For more information about how **docassemble** handles different
languages, see the [language and locale settings] section and the
[functions] section (specifically the functions [`set_language()`] and
[`word()`]).

## <a name="currency_symbol"></a>Currency symbol

You can set a default currency symbol if the symbol generated by
the locale is not what you want:

{% highlight yaml %}
currency symbol: €
{% endhighlight %}

This symbol will be used in the user interface when a [field] has the
`datatype` of [`currency`].  It will also be used in the
[`currency_symbol()`] function defined in [`docassemble.base.util`].

## <a name="fileserver"></a>URL to central file server

If you are using a [multi-server arrangement] you can reduce
bandwidth on your web server(s) by setting `fileserver` to a URL path to
a dedicated file server:

{% highlight yaml %}
fileserver: https://files.example.com/da/
{% endhighlight %}

Always use a trailing slash.

If this directive is not set, the value of [`root`] will be used to
create URLs to uploaded files and static files.

Note that if you are using [Azure blob storage] or [S3], the URLs to
files will point directly to files stored in the cloud, so there would
be no reason for a **docassemble** file server.

## <a name="google"></a>Google API key

If you have a Google API key, you can include it as follows:

{% highlight yaml %}
google:
  api key: UIJGeyD-23aSdgSE34gEGRg3GDRGdrge9z-YUia
{% endhighlight %}

This is required for the use of the [`map_of()`] feature.

This will also enable you to use the [Google Maps Geocoding API]
without limits (see the [`.geolocate()`] method), and will also enable
the [Google Cloud Translation API] for the feature in Utilities for
translating system words into other languages.

As of June 2018, Google requires that you enable billing on the API key
in order to use the geocoding feature. See:
https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geolocation/usage-and-billing
To avoid charges, you may want to restrict the API to no more than 2,500 
requests per day. See: https://developers.google.com/maps/faq#usage_cap

If you specify a specific `google maps api key`, this key will be used
for the [`map_of()`] feature and the [address autocomplete] feature
instead of the `api key`.

{% highlight yaml %}
google:
  api key: UIJGeyD-23aSdgSE34gEGRg3GDRGdrge9z-YUia
  google maps api key: YyFeyuE-36grDgEE34jETRy3WDjGerye0y-wrRb
{% endhighlight %}

If you use both geocoding and Google Maps, you will probably want to
use a separate `google maps api key` because you can secure it
differently.  Note that the [`map_of()`] feature puts its API key in
the [JavaScript] source, and the contact with Google's server will
come from the user's computer.  By contrast, when you use the
[`.geolocate()`] method, the contact with Google's server comes from
your server.  Thus, you may wish to secure the `api key` using IP
addresses, and secure the `google maps api key` using "Referer"
headers.

If you use the [Google Cloud Translation API] for the feature in
Utilities that translates system phrases into other languages, you can
control how many phrases are translated in a single request to the
API.

{% highlight yaml %}
google translate words at a time: 40
{% endhighlight %}

The default number is 20.

## <a name="service account credentials"></a>Google service account credentials

If you want to integrate with [Google Docs] or [Google Drive], you can
add `service account credentials`, which is a [JSON] object you obtain
from the [Google Developers Console].

To do this, go on the [Google Developers Console] and create an "app."
Within this app, create a [service account].  When you create the
service account, you will be provided with "credentials."  Download
the [JSON] (not p12) credential file for the service account.

Then, in the configuration, set `service account credentials` under
[`google`] to the literal contents of the [JSON] file you downloaded.
(Make sure to provide the necessary indentation so that the [YAML] is
valid.)

For example:

{% highlight yaml %}
google:
  service account credentials: |
    {
      "type": "service_account",
      "project_id": "redacted",
      "private_key_id": "redacted",
      "private_key": "-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----REDACTED-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n",
      "client_email": "googledocs@redacted.iam.gserviceaccount.com",
      "client_id": "redacted",
      "auth_uri": "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth",
      "token_uri": "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/token",
      "auth_provider_x509_cert_url": "https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/certs",
      "client_x509_cert_url": "https://www.googleapis.com/robot/v1/metadata/x509/googledocs%40redacted.iam.gserviceaccount.com"
    }
{% endhighlight %}

## <a name="google analytics"></a>Google Analytics ID

If you want to use [Google Analytics] on the screens in your interviews,
you can set `analytics id` within the `google` directive:

{% highlight yaml %}
google:
  analytics id: UA-77777777-1
{% endhighlight %}

When this is configured, [JavaScript] for [Google Analytics] will be
inserted into your interview pages, and [pageview] events will be sent
to [Google Analytics] for any `question` that has an `id` defined.
These [pageview] events will record a view on an artificial path.  For
example, suppose you have the following question:

{% highlight yaml %}
id: lead certification
question: |
  Does your landlord have a valid lead certification?
yesno: lead_certification_exists
{% endhighlight %}

Suppose this question is part of the interview `answer.yml` in the
package `docassemble.eviction`.  In that case, the `pageview` will
record a view of the following pseudo-URL on your site:

> /eviction/answer/lead_certification

## <a name="voicerss"></a>VoiceRSS API key

If the [special variable `speak_text`] is set to `True`, **docassemble**
will present the user with an audio control that will convert the text
of the question to speech.  This relies on the [VoiceRSS] web service.
You will need to obtain an API key from [VoiceRSS] and set the
configuration below in order for this feature to function.  (The
service allows 350 free requests per day.)

{% highlight yaml %}
voicerss:
  enable: True
  key: 347593849874e7454b9872948a87987d
  languages:
    en: us
    es: mx
    fr: fr
{% endhighlight %}

The `enable` key must be set to `True` in order for the text-to-speech
feature to work.  The `key` is the [VoiceRSS] API key.  The
`languages` key refers to a dictionary that associates languages with
default dialects to be used with that language.

## <a name="ocr languages"></a>OCR language settings

The [`ocr_file()`] function uses the [Tesseract]<span></span>
[optical character recognition] (OCR) application to extract text from
image files and PDF files.  One of the options for the OCR process is
the language being recognized.  The codes for language that
[Tesseract] uses are different from those that **docassemble** uses.
In most cases, the code that [Tesseract] uses is the [ISO-639-3] code
that corresponds to the [ISO-639-1] code that **docassemble** uses,
and **docassemble** can make this conversion automatically.  However,
in some cases this does not work, so there is an override, which is
controlled by the `ocr languages` directive.  The default value maps
Chinese to Traditional Chinese:

{% highlight yaml %}
ocr languages:
  zh: chi-tra
{% endhighlight %}

If all of the Chinese documents that you want to OCR are written in
Simplified Chinese, and all the Uzbek documents are written in
Cyrillic, you could set the following:

{% highlight yaml %}
ocr languages:
  zh: chi-sim
  uz: uzb-cyrl
{% endhighlight %}

For more information, see the documentation of the [`ocr_file()`] function.

## <a name="aws"></a>Amazon Web Services directives

### <a name="s3"></a>s3

If you are using [Amazon S3] to store shared files, enter your access
keys, [bucket] name, and [region name] as follows:

{% highlight yaml %}
s3:
  enable: True
  access key id: FWIEJFIJIDGISEJFWOEF
  secret access key: RGERG34eeeg3agwetTR0+wewWAWEFererNRERERG
  bucket: yourbucketname
  region: us-west-1
{% endhighlight %}

You will need to create the [bucket] before using it; **docassemble**
will not create it for you.

### <a name="azure"></a>azure

If you are using [Azure blob storage] to store shared files, enter
your account name, account key, and container name as follows:

{% highlight yaml %}
azure:
  enable: False
  account name: example-com
  account key: 1TGSCr2P2uSw9/CLoucfNIAEFcqakAC7kiVwJsKLX65X3yugWwnNFRgQRfRHtenGVcc5KujusYUNnXXGXruDCA==
  container: yourcontainername
{% endhighlight %}

You will need to create the container before using it; **docassemble**
will not create it for you.

### <a name="ec2"></a>ec2

If you are running **docassemble** from within an [Amazon EC2]
instance, or a [Docker] container within such an instance, set this to
true:

{% highlight yaml %}
ec2: True
{% endhighlight %}

This is necessary because when **docassemble** runs in a
[multi-server arrangement], each **docassemble** web server instance
needs to allow other **docassemble** web instances to send messages to
it through [supervisor].  Each web server instance advertises the
hostname or IP address through which its [supervisor] can be accessed.
Normally, this can be obtained using the computer's hostname, but
within an [EC2] instance or [Docker] container, this hostname is not
one that other web servers can resolve.  If `ec2` is set to `True`,
then **docassemble** will determine the hostname by calling
`http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/local-ipv4`.

### <a name="ec2 ip url"></a>ec2 ip url

If `ec2` is set to `True`, **docassemble** will determine the hostname
by calling `http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/local-ipv4`.  If
this URL does not work for some reason, but a different URL would
work, you can change the URL that **docassemble** uses by setting the
`ec2 ip url` configuration item.

{% highlight yaml %}
ec2 ip url: http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/local-ipv4
{% endhighlight %}

## <a name="api privileges"></a>API usage

By default, only users with privileges of `admin` or `developer` may
obtain an API key in order to use the **docassemble** [API].  You can
change this by editing the `api privileges`.

{% highlight yaml %}
api privileges:
  - admin
  - developer
  - user
{% endhighlight %}

## <a name="password login"></a>Password login

If `password login` is set to `False`, then users will not see an
option for entering their username and password on the login screen;
they will only see buttons for other login methods that you have
enabled.  The default value is `True`.

Since there is a possibility that your other login methods will fail,
there is a "back door" that bypasses this setting, so that you as the
administrator can still log in using a username and password.  Instead
of going to `/user/sign-in` in the web browser, go to
`/user/sign-in?admin=1`.  The username and password fields will be
shown, regardless of the `password login` setting.

## <a name="phone login"></a>Phone number login

If `phone login` is set to `True`, then **docassemble** will allow
users to log in with a phone number.  For this system to work, the
[`twilio`] configuration must be set up.  The user needs to put in his
or her phone number, and then a random verification code will be sent
to that phone number via [SMS].  The user needs to type in that code
in order to log in.  As with the
[external authentication methods](#oauth), registration happens
automatically upon the first login.  Subsequent logins will also
require entering a random verification code.

The details of how this login system functions, such as the number of
digits in the verification code and the number of seconds that the
code remains valid, can be [configured](#brute force).

## <a name="mfa"></a>Two-factor authentication

For added security, you can allow users who log in with passwords to
enable two-factor authentication on their accounts.  The two-factor
authentication system can use [Google Authenticator], [Authy], or
another compatible app.  Or, if you have set up a [`twilio`]
configuration, the system can send a verification code to the user in
an [SMS] message.

To give your users the option of using two-factor authentication, set
`two factor authentication` to `True`.  Logged-in users will then see
an option on their "Profile" page for configuring two-factor
authentication.  By default, only administrators and developers see an
option on their user profile to configure second-factor
authentication.  To configure which privileges have the option of using
second factor authentication, set `two factor authentication privileges` to
the full list of [privileges] you want to be able to use the feature.

{% highlight yaml %}
two factor authentication: True
two factor authentication privileges:
  - admin
  - developer
  - user
  - advocate
{% endhighlight %}

Two-factor authentication is not available to users who sign in with
[external authentication methods](#oauth) or who are using the
[phone login] feature.

## <a name="vim"></a>Vim-like editor in Playground

If the `vim` directive is set to `True`, then the in-browser text
editors in the [Playground] will emulate [Vim].  This uses the
[Vim bindings option] of [CodeMirror].

## <a name="external hostname"></a>URL to the site

The `external hostname` is the hostname by which users will access
**docassemble**.  If users will see `https://docassemble.example.com` in
the location bar on the web browser, `external hostname` will be
`docassemble.example.com`.

{% highlight yaml %}
external hostname: docassemble.example.com
{% endhighlight %}

This variable is only effective if **docassemble** is running on
[Docker].  It is typically set by the [`DAHOSTNAME`] environment
variable when the `docker run` command is run for the first time.

If you change `external hostname`, you need to do a complete restart
of the system for the change to take effect.  (That is, `docker -t60
stop <container ID>` followed by `docker start <container ID>`.)

## <a name="behind https load balancer"></a>When behind a proxy

Set the `behind https load balancer` directive to `True` if you are
running **docassemble** in a configuration where **docassemble**
itself is running [HTTP], but requests are being forwarded to it by a
server running HTTPS.  This might be your configuration if you are
using a [load balancer] or you are running [Docker] on machine that
[forwards] HTTPS requests to [Docker] on a non-standard [HTTP] port.

This variable is typically set using the [Docker] environment variable
[`BEHINDHTTPSLOADBALANCER`].

If you change this variable, you need to do a complete restart of the
system for the change to take effect.  (That is, 
`docker -t60 stop <container ID>` followed by `docker start <container ID>`.)

## <a name="use lets encrypt"></a><a name="lets encrypt email"></a>Using Let's Encrypt

If you are using [Docker] and you want your server to use [HTTPS] set
up through [Let's Encrypt], you can set the following in your
[Configuration].

{% highlight yaml %}
external hostname: docassemble.example.com
use https: True
use lets encrypt: True
lets encrypt email: jsmith@example.com
{% endhighlight %}

These variables are typically set through the environment variables
[`DAHOSTNAME`], [`USEHTTPS`], [`USELETSENCRYPT`], and [`LETSENCRYPTEMAIL`] when the
`docker run` command is run for the first time.  You can change the
`use https`, `use lets encrypt`, and `lets encrypt email` variables on
a running server, but they will only be effective if you restart the
system using `docker -t60 stop <container ID>` followed by 
`docker start <container ID>`.

## <a name="cross site domain"></a>Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)

Set the `cross site domain` directive if you want your [Apache] server
to be configured to send `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` headers in
order to permit [Cross-Origin Resource Sharing].  If you set it to
`*`, resource sharing will be allowed to any origin.  Or, you could
set it to, e.g., `api.example.com` to limit sharing to a particular
domain.

{% highlight yaml %}
cross site domain: api.example.com
{% endhighlight %}

This variable is only used if **docassemble** is running on
[Docker].

If you change this variable, you need to do a complete restart of the
system for the change to take effect.  (That is, 
`docker -t60 stop <container ID>` followed by `docker start <container ID>`).

## <a name="incoming mail domain"></a>E-mail domain of the site

If you use the [e-mail receiving] feature, set the `incoming mail
domain` to whatever e-mail domain will direct e-mail to the
**docassemble** server configured to perform the `all` or `mail`
services.

{% highlight yaml %}
incoming mail domain: mail.example.com
{% endhighlight %}

The [`interview_email()`] function will then return an e-mail address
with `@mail.example.com` at the end.

If `incoming mail domain` is not specified, the value of
[`external hostname`] will be used.

## <a name="cert install directory"></a>Location of SSL certificates

The `cert install directory` directive indicates the directory where
the web server expects SSL certificates to reside.  By default, this
is `/etc/ssl/docassemble`, but you can change it to wherever the web
server will look for SSL certificates.  This is only applicable if you
are using HTTPS.

In a [multi-server arrangement] or [Docker], a [supervisor] process
will run as root upon startup that will copy files from the [`certs`]
directory to the `cert install directory` and set appropriate file
permissions on the certificates.

## <a name="log server"></a>Log server hostname

If the `log server` directive is set, **docassemble** will write log
messages to TCP port 514 on the hostname indicated by `log server`
instead of writing them to
`/usr/share/docassemble/log/docassemble.log` (or whatever other
directory is set in [`log`]).

## <a name="redis"></a>Redis server location

By default, **docassemble** assumes that the [Redis] server is located
on the same server as the web server.  You can designate a different
[Redis] server by setting the `redis` directive:

{% highlight yaml %}
redis: redis://192.168.0.2
{% endhighlight %}

The `redis` directive needs to be written in the form of a
[redis URI].

## <a name="rabbitmq"></a>RabbitMQ server location

By default, **docassemble** assumes that the [RabbitMQ] server is located
on the same server as the web server.  You can designate a different
[RabbitMQ] server by setting the `rabbitmq` directive:

{% highlight yaml %}
rabbitmq: amqp://guest@192.168.0.2//
{% endhighlight %}

The `rabbitmq` directive needs to be written in the form of an [AMQP
URI].

## <a name="imagemagick"></a><a name="pdftoppm"></a>Image conversion

By default, **docassemble** assumes that you have [ImageMagick] and
pdftoppm installed on your system, and that they are accessible
through the commands `convert` and `pdftoppm`, respectively.  If you
do not have these applications on your system, you need to set the
configuration variables to null:

{% highlight yaml %}
imagemagick: Null
pdftoppm: Null
{% endhighlight %}

If you have the applications, but you want to specify a particular
path, you can set the path using the configuration variables:

{% highlight yaml %}
imagemagick: /usr/local/bin/convert
pdftoppm: /usr/local/bin/pdftoppm
{% endhighlight %}

## <a name="pacpl"></a><a name="avconv"></a>Sound file conversion

By default, **docassemble** assumes that you have pacpl (the
[Perl Audio Converter] and/or [avconv] installed on your system, and
that they are accessible through the commands `pacpl` and
`avconv`, respectively.  If you do not have these applications on
your system, you need to set the configuration variables to null:

{% highlight yaml %}
pacpl: Null
avconv: Null
{% endhighlight %}

You can also set these variables to tell **docassemble** to use a
particular path on your system to run these applications.

If you have [ffmpeg] instead of [avconv], you can do:

{% highlight yaml %}
avconv: ffmpeg
{% endhighlight %}

## <a name="libreoffice"></a><a name="pandoc"></a>Document conversion

**docassemble** requires that you have [Pandoc] installed on your
system.  It assumes that it can be run using the command `pandoc`.
If you need to specify a different path, you can do so in the configuration:

{% highlight yaml %}
pandoc: /opt/pandoc/bin/pandoc
{% endhighlight %}

By default, **docassemble** assumes that you have [LibreOffice]
installed on your system, and that it is accessible through the
command `libreoffice`.  If you do not have LibreOffice on your system,
you need to set the configuration variable to null:

{% highlight yaml %}
libreoffice: Null
{% endhighlight %}

You can also use this configuration variable to set a different path
for the application.  There are different versions of [LibreOffice]
that go by different names:

{% highlight yaml %}
libreoffice: soffice
{% endhighlight %}

## <a name="pandoc engine"></a>Pandoc's LaTeX engine

By default, [Pandoc] uses `pdflatex` to generate PDF files from
[Markdown].  If you would like to use a different engine, you can
specify it using the `pandoc engine` directive:

{% highlight yaml %}
pandoc engine: xelatex
{% endhighlight %}

## <a name="pdfa"></a>Producing PDF/A files

If you want the [PDF] files produced by interviews on your server to be
in [PDF/A] format, you can set this as a default:

{% highlight yaml %}
pdf/a: True
{% endhighlight %}

The default is `False`.  The setting can also be made on a
per-interview basis by setting the [`pdf/a` features setting].

## <a name="maximum image size"></a>Limiting size of uploaded images

If your users upload digital photos into your interviews, the uploads
may take a long time.  Using the [`maximum image size` field modifier]
or the [`maximum image size` interview feature], you can cause your
users' web browsers to reduce the size of your images before uploading
them.  For example, if `maximum image size` is set to 1200, then the
image will be reduced in size if it is taller or wider than 1200
pixels.

Note that the image file type of the uploaded file may be changed to
[PNG] during the conversion process.  Different browsers behave
differently.

If you would like to set a site-wide default value for the maximum
image size, you can use the `maximum image size` configuration
directive:

{% highlight yaml %}
maximum image size: 1200
{% endhighlight %}

This is just a default value; it can be overridden for a given
interview using the [`maximum image size` interview feature] and it
can be overridden for a given field using the
[`maximum image size` field modifier].  To override the setting in
order to allow image uploads of any resolution, use `None` as the
override value.

## <a name="celery processes"></a>Number of concurrent background tasks

**docassemble** uses [Celery] to execute background tasks.  The
[Celery] system is able to execute multiple tasks concurrently.  The
number of concurrent processes is limited by default to the number of
CPU cores on the machine.  If you want to increase the number of
processes, set the `celery processes` directive.

{% highlight yaml %}
celery processes: 15
{% endhighlight %}

This value will be passed directly to [Celery]'s [`worker_concurrency`]
configuration variable.

## <a name="office addin url"></a>Microsoft Word sidebar

You will need to set `office addin url` if you are running a
[Microsoft Word sidebar] from a location other than your own server.

As a security measure, when a [Microsoft Word sidebar] communicates
with your server, your **docassemble** server will only allow
communications that come from a particular hostname on the internet.

The `office addin url` directive in the Configuration specifies which
hostname is allowed.

{% highlight yaml %}
office addin url: https://sidebar.example.com
{% endhighlight %}

This means that your server will only allow [Microsoft Word sidebar]
communications that originate from https://sidebar.example.com.

If you don't set `office addin url`, the value of [`url root`] will be
used, and if [`url root`] is not set, the URL will be discerned from
the HTTP request.  However, if your server is behind a proxy, this
latter method may not be accurate, so should [`url root`] in order for
the [Microsoft Word sidebar] to work correctly.

Note that a Word sidebar is just a web page that consists of an [HTML]
file with some [CSS] and [JavaScript] files associated with it.  These
files can be hosted on any site on the internet as long as HTTPS is in
use.  (Microsoft requires HTTPS.)  When your Microsoft Word
application accesses this web page, you can click the "Use a different
server" button to instruct the sidebar to access the [Playground] on
any server to which you have access.  Then the [JavaScript] on the page
will communicate directly with that server and pass information back
and forth between Microsoft Word and the [Playground] on the server.

Your **docassemble** server can serve as the host for the web page.
If your server's hostname is https://interviews.example.com, then the
sidebar will be available at
https://interviews.example.com/officetaskpane.  If you create an [XML
manifest file] for the sidebar from the [Utilities] page of your
server, you will see this URL embedded in the XML.

## <a name="timezone"></a>Setting the time zone

Functions like [`as_datetime()`] that deal with dates will use a
default time zone if an explicit timezone is not supplied.  If you set
the `timezone` directive to something like `America/Los_Angeles`, this
will be used as the default time zone.  Otherwise, the default time
zone will be set to the time zone of the server.

{% highlight yaml %}
timezone: America/Los_Angeles
{% endhighlight %}

## <a name="pypi"></a>Sharing packages on PyPI

If you want users of your server to be able to publish packages to
[PyPI] from the [packages folder] of the [Playground], set `pypi` to `True`:

{% highlight yaml %}
pypi: True
{% endhighlight %}

You can also tweak the operation of **docassemble**'s interaction with
[PyPI] by setting the following optional directives (which you should
never need to do):

{% highlight yaml %}
pypi url: https://pypi.python.org/pypi
pypirc path: /var/www/.pypirc
{% endhighlight %}

The `pypi url` directive refers to the repository to use for publishing.
It should not have a trailing slash.

The `pypirc path` directive refers to the file where the repository
URL will be stored.  You may need to edit this if you run
**docassemble** on a non-standard operating system.

## <a name="oauth"></a>Facebook, Twitter, Google, Auth0, and Azure login

If you want to enable logging in with Facebook, Twitter, Google,
Auth0, or Microsoft Azure, you will need to tell **docassemble** your
[OAuth2] keys for these services:

{% highlight yaml %}
oauth:
  facebook:
    enable: True
    id: 423759825983740
    secret: 34993a09909c0909b9000a090d09f099
  google:
    enable: True
    id: 23123018240-32239fj28fj4fuhf394h3984eurhfurh.apps.googleusercontent.com
    secret: DGE34gdgerg3GDG545tgdfRf
  auth0:
    enable: True
    id: ceyd6imTYxTNmuj2CYpwH_cEhdWt93e6
    secret: LLGEBDrrgDFDfBsFjErsdSdsntkrtAbfa4ee3ss_adfdSDFEWEsfgHTerjNsd3dD
    domain: example.auth0.com
  twitter:
    enable: True
    id: Iweh63ReKfOCttaUBE3t27TET
    secret: hfieegGgrht5re3hfhsRGStYUbDDAgerergrggSDGHtrErE7rf
  azure:
    enable: True
    id: e378beb1-0bfb-45bc-9b4b-604dcf640c87
    secret: UwHEze20pzSO+lvywJOjcos3v7Kd6Y7tsaCYTG7Panc=
{% endhighlight %}

You can disable these login methods by setting `enable` to `False` or
by removing the configuration entirely.

For more information about how to obtain these keys, see the
[installation] page's sections on [Facebook], [Twitter], [Google],
[Auth0], and [Azure].

Note that in [YAML], dictionary keys must be unique.  So you can only
have one `ouath:` line in your configuration.  Put all of your
[OAuth2] configuration details (for Google logins, Google Drive
integration, OneDrive integration, etc.) within a single `oauth`
directive.

## <a name="googledrive"></a>Google Drive configuration

To enable the [Google Drive synchronization] feature, add
a `googledrive` entry to your [`oauth`](#oauth) configuration with
your [OAuth2] keys for [Google Drive].

{% highlight yaml %}
oauth:
  googledrive:
    enable: True
    id: 23123018240-32239fj28fj4fuhf394h3984eurhfurh.apps.googleusercontent.com
    secret: DGE34gdgerg3GDG545tgdfRf
{% endhighlight %}

For more information about obtaining these keys, see the 
[Google Drive]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/installation.html#google drive)
section of the [installation] page.

## <a name="onedrive"></a>OneDrive configuration

To enable the [OneDrive synchronization] feature, add
a `onedrive` entry to your [`oauth`](#oauth) configuration with
your [OAuth2] keys for [OneDrive].

{% highlight yaml %}
oauth:
  onedrive:
    enable: True
    id: 7df57ca4-d736-84b3-9aec-746c63b8e88d
    secret: "xcyTW522[bip)BIWXY92YsT"
{% endhighlight %}

For more information about obtaining these keys, see the 
[OneDrive]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/installation.html#onedrive)
section of the [installation] page.

## <a name="github"></a>GitHub configuration

To enable the [GitHub integration] feature, add
a `github` entry to your [`oauth`](#oauth) configuration with
your [OAuth2] keys for [GitHub].

{% highlight yaml %}
oauth:
  github:
    enable: True
    id: 78df98b2573io5d78a1b
    secret: 75dc98473847a7c938f8beeee87f322fcb980232
{% endhighlight %}

For more information about obtaining these keys, see the 
[GitHub integration]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/installation.html#github)
section of the [installation] page.

## <a name="twilio"></a>Twilio configuration

There are several features of **docassemble** that involve integration
with the [Twilio] service, including the [`send_sms()`] function for
sending text messages, the [text messaging interface] for interacting
with interviewees through text messaging, the [call forwarding]
feature for connecting interviewees with operators over the phone, and
the [fax sending] feature.

These features are enabled using a `twilio` configuration directive.
Here is an example:

{% highlight yaml %}
twilio:
  sms: True
  voice: True
  fax: True
  account sid: ACfad8e668d876f5473fb232a311243b58
  auth token: 87559c7a427c25e34e20c654e8b05234
  number: "+12762410114"
  dispatch:
    color: docassemble.base:data/questions/examples/buttons-code-color.yml
    doors: docassemble.base:data/questions/examples/doors.yml
  default interview: docassemble.base:data/questions/default-interview.yml
{% endhighlight %}

The `sms: True` line tells **docassemble** that you intend to use the
text messaging features.

The `voice: True` line tells **docassemble** that you intend to use the
[call forwarding] feature.

The `fax: True` line tells **docassemble** that you intend to use the
[fax sending] feature.

The `account sid` is a value you copy and paste from your [Twilio]
account dashboard.

The `auth token` is another value you copy and paste from your
[Twilio] account dashboard.  This is only necessary if you intend to
use the [`send_sms()`] function or the [phone login] feature.

The `number` is the phone number you purchased.  The phone number
must be written in [E.164] format.  This is the phone number with
which your users will exchange [SMS] messages.

The `dispatch` configuration allows you to direct users to different
interviews.  For example, with the above configuration, you can tell
your prospective users to "text 'color' to 276-241-0114."  Users who
initiate a conversation by sending the SMS message "help" to the
[Twilio] phone number will be started into the
`docassemble.base:data/questions/examples/sms.yml` interview.

The [`default interview`] configuration allows you to set an interview
that will be used in case the user's initial message does not match up
with a `dispatch` entry.  If you do not set a [`default interview`], the
global [`default interview`] will be used.  If you want unknown
messages to be ignored, set [`default interview`] to `null`.

### <a name="multiple twilio"></a>Multiple Twilio configurations

You can use multiple [Twilio] configurations on the same server.  You
might wish to do this if you want to advertise more than one [Twilio]
number to your users.  You can do this by specifying the `twilio`
directive as a list of dictionaries, and giving each dictionary a
`name`.  In this example, there are two configurations, one named
`default`, and one named `bankruptcy`:

{% highlight yaml %}
twilio:
  - name: default
    sms: True
    voice: True
    fax: True
    account sid: ACfad8e668d876f5473fb232a311243b58
    auth token: auth token: 87559c7a427c25e34e20c654e8b05234
    number: "+12762410114"
    default interview: docassemble.base:data/questions/examples/sms.yml
    dispatch:
      color: docassemble.base:data/questions/examples/buttons-code-color.yml
      doors: docassemble.base:data/questions/examples/doors.yml
    default interview: docassemble.base:data/questions/default-interview.yml
  - name: bankruptcy
    sms: True
    voice: False
    fax: False
    account sid: ACfad8e668d876f5473fb232a311243b58
    auth token: auth token: 87559c7a427c25e34e20c654e8b05234
    number: "+12768571217"
    default interview: docassemble.bankruptcy:data/questions/bankruptcy.yml
    dispatch:
      adversary: docassemble.base:data/questions/adversary-case.yml
      chapter7: docassemble.base:data/questions/bankruptcy.yml
{% endhighlight %}

When you call [`send_sms()`], you can indicate which configuration
should be used:

{% highlight python %}
send_sms(to='202-943-0949', body='Hi there!', config='bankruptcy')
{% endhighlight %}

This will cause the message to be sent from 276-857-1217.

If no configuration is named `default`, the first configuration will
be used as the default.  The [call forwarding] feature uses the
default configuration.

## <a name="user agent"></a>User agent for downloading files

Functions such as [`path_and_mimetype()`] will download files from the
internet.  When the server downloads the file, it reports its [user
agent] as `Python-urllib/2.7` by default.  This might cause problems
for your interviews because some web sites may not want to serve files
to a user that identifies itself as a "robot."

To use a different [user agent], you can set the `user agent`
configuration directive.  For example:

{% highlight yaml %}
user agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:59.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/59.0
{% endhighlight %}

## <a name="brute force"></a>Protecting against multiple login attempts

By default, users who unsuccessfully log in are blocked after 10
failed attempts.  This threshold can be configured with `attempt
limit`.

The time period for blocking defaults to 86,400 seconds (one day).
The number of seconds of blocking can be configured with `ban period`.

When you use the [phone login] feature, the user needs to enter a 5
digit code that they receive via SMS.  The number of digits in this
code can be configured with `verification code digits`.  The code is
only valid for a limited period of time.  This period of time defaults
to 180 seconds and is configurable with `verification code timeout`.

{% highlight yaml %}
attempt limit: 5
ban period: 3600
verification code digits: 6
verification code timeout: 360
{% endhighlight %}

## <a name="loop limit"></a><a name="recursion limit"></a>Infinite loop protection

Since **docassemble** allows you to write code in a declarative
fashion, it needs to do a lot of looping and recursion.  If you make a
mistake in your [interview logic] and use circular reasoning, you may
send **docassemble** into an infinite loop.  Sometimes these infinite
loops can be detected and a warning raised, but other times they are
hard to detect because even deliberate code could loop or recurse for
a long time.  Thus, **docassemble** has hard limits on the amount of
looping and recursion it will do.  By default, these limits are set to
500 loops and 500 recursions.  If you get an error that "there appears to
be an infinite loop" or "there appears to be a circularity," then
these limits were exceeded.  If you want to change these limits on a
global level in your system, you can include use the `loop limit` and
`recursion limit` directives:

{% highlight yaml %}
loop limit: 600
recursion limit 600
{% endhighlight %}

It is important that some reasonable limit be in place, because if the
server is in development mode, an infinite loop could result in the
memory of the machine being exceeded, which could
cause the system to crash.

You can also change these limits on a per-interview basis with the
[`loop limit` and `recursion limit` features]

# <a name="get_config"></a>Adding your own configuration variables

Feel free to use the configuration file to pass your own variables to
your code.  To retrieve their values, use the [`get_config()`] function from
[`docassemble.base.util`]:

{% highlight yaml %}
---
modules:
  - docassemble.base.util
---
code: |
  trello_api_key = get_config('trello api key')
{% endhighlight %}

[`get_config()`] will return `None` if you ask it for a value that does
not exist in the configuration.

The values retrieved by [`get_config()`] are the result of importing the
[YAML] in the configuration file.  As a result, the values may be
text, lists, or dictionaries, or any nested combination of these
types, depending on what is written in the configuration file.

It is a good practice to use the configuration file to store any
sensitive information, such as passwords and API keys.  This allows
you to share your code on [GitHub] without worrying about redacting it
first.

# <a name="alternatelocation"></a>Using a configuration file in a different location

If you want **docassemble** to read its configuration from a location
other than `/usr/share/docassemble/config/config.yml`, you can set the
`DA_CONFIG_FILE` environment variable to another file location.  You
might want to do this if you have multiple virtual hosts, each running
a different [WSGI] application on a single server.

Note that the configuration file needs to be readable and writable by
the web server, but should not be readable by other users of the
system because it may contain sensitive information, such as Google
and Facebook API keys.
