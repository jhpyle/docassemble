# Slack

To get help from the community of developers and other users, join the
[**docassemble** Slack group].  If you would prefer not to ask a
question to the group, you can send a private message in the Slack to
the developer, Jonathan Pyle.

# Mailing list

It is also a good idea to join the [docassemble mailing list].  The
mailing list is much less active than the [Slack] group, but it will
allow you to receive important announcements if you don't check the
[Slack group] every day.

# Help with deployment and development

If deploying a web app and writing "code" are barriers, there are
[third party providers] who provide platforms based on **docassemble**
and offer "no code" tools for deployment and development.

# Tutorials

[ttamg] wrote up 
[instructions](https://github.com/ttamg/deploy-docassemble/tree/master/digitalocean-setup)

[Quinten Steenhuis] has written a number of tutorials on
[his blog](https://www.nonprofittechy.com/blog/),

[John Gibson](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8iZ3ft6Ipg4IYdQtEUtiZw)

that walks through the process of installing **docassemble** on [Microsoft Azure]
and running an interview that accesses a SQL server.

# Bugs

If you find a bug, please [submit an issue on GitHub].  Keep in mind
that not all error messages represent bugs; it might be the case that
you misconfigured your system or you have a mistake in your code.  It
is a good idea to ask a question about the error message first.
