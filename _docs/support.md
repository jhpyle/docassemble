# <a name="slack"></a>Slack

To get help from the community of developers and other users, join the
[**docassemble** Slack group].  If you would prefer not to ask a
question to the group, you can send a private message in the Slack to
the developer, Jonathan Pyle.

# <a name="mailing"></a>Mailing list

It is also a good idea to join the [docassemble mailing list].  The
mailing list is much less active than the [Slack] group, but it will
allow you to receive important announcements if you don't check the
[Slack group] every day.
