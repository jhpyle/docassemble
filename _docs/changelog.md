- The `only_if_empty` option on the `reset_gathered()` method.

  interviews in these packages are always inoperable unless the server
  is in `debug` mode.

### Fixed
- The `server_capabilities()` was not recognizing the `enable`

  and there are more than ten decorations, no preview images will be
  shown in "Variables, etc."
- The values of `SavedFile` objects will be cached in memory for the
  duration of a web request, so that when you create a new
  `SavedFile`, attributes will be set from memory.
- The first argument to a `MachineLearner` object will no longer be
  used as a literal `group_id`.  Rather, an argument `'fruit'` it will
  be converted into a group_id of the form
  `docassemble.packagename:data/sources/ml-interviewname.json:fruit`.
  You can still set a literal `group_id` using the keyword parameter
  `group_id`.
- When an `initial_file` is given to a `MachineLearner` object, two
  different formats can be used: an array, or a dictionary of arrays.
  If a dictionary of arrays, the keys will be checked and if the key
  matches the `group_id` (with the part before the final
  colon, if any, removed), the array corresponding to that key will be
  used.

### Fixed
- Playground wizard not including pdf and docx template files in package.
- Playground wizard not including static files in package.
- Playground wizard pickle error when using S3 or Azure blob storage.

  longer executes as a mandatory block unless it is marked as
  mandatory.
- In addition, the way that questions are asked has changed
  accordingly.  If any fields that would be set by the question have
  attributes, **docassemble** will try to ensure that the underlying
  variable is already defined, which may trigger a process of defining
  the variable.  This will ensure that objects mentioned in object
  blocks will be created before they are necessary.
- These new changes enable the use of iterator variables like `i` in
 `objects` blocks.

### Fixed
- Problem with deletion of keys on S3.
- Problem with response() on second and subsequent screens.

  option by default, and input validation ensures that something is
  checked.  The `none of the above` field modifer configures it.
- After registration, users will bypass the "Interviews" screen and
  go right back to their interview, if they have started an interview.

### Added
- Option in `fields` called `uncheck others` when `datatype` is

- Support for help text next to choices in a multiple choice list.

### Changed
- Database upgrades now handled by alembic by default.  See the 'use
  alembic' configuration directive.
- Extension packages no longer depend on the docassemble.base or
  docassemble.webapp packages.  As a result, installation of an
  extension package will no longer trigger a total software update.
  If you want to upgrade docassemble, upgrade docassemble.webapp.
  Note that packages created in earlier versions will still have these
  dependencies until they are regenerated in the Playground.  You can
  always edit `install_requires` in the setup.py file.

### Fixed
