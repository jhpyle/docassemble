## [0.2.1](https://github.com/jhpyle/docassemble/releases/tag/v0.2.1) - 2017-11-30

### Changed
- The hard-coded limit on JSON nesting depth, which was mentioned 
  in the 0.2.0 changes, has been changed from 6 to 20.

### Fixed
- Apache could not start unless Docker container started with a 
  `DAHOSTNAME`.
- GitHub push using GitHub integration failed because of an SSH 
  issue.

## [0.2.0](https://github.com/jhpyle/docassemble/releases/tag/v0.2.0) - 2017-11-29

### Added
- The `logo` option of `set_title()` and `metadata`.

### Changed
- The `all_variables()` and `variables_as_json()` functions now
  contain a limitation on nesting depth.  The limit is hard-coded at 
  6 levels, after which values will be "null."  This is to prevent
  exceptions being triggered by circular references.
- Setting Google Drive Synchronization folder to "Do not link" will
  now erase the connection between the OAuth app and the user.
- When populating PDF checkboxes, passing `None` to the checkbox or to
  the `yesno()` or `noyes()` functions will result in the box not
  being checked.
- Apache web server variables are now reset after a restart (e.g.,
  after the Configuration is changed.
- When pulling the contents of a **docassemble** extension package
  into the Playground, it will now remember the GitHub URL or PyPI
  package name so that when you go to Pull again, you will not need to
  retype.  This works even if you have not enabled GitHub integration.

### Fixed
- PDF checkbox inconsistencies.
- Git pull into Playground packages without integration generated an
  error message.
- When datatype is object and variable existed, it would try to reduce
  the object to text in order to see if it should be highlighted as a
  pre-selected default value.

## [0.1.99](https://github.com/jhpyle/docassemble/releases/tag/v0.1.99) - 2017-11-23

### Added
- Option for changing the UID and GID of www-data within the Docker
  container, so that `/usr/share/docassemble/files` can be mounted as
  a Docker volume and the Playground files can be edited.

### Changed
- Multiple choice questions in `fields` will set boolean `True` or
  `False` if those are the only options.
- Additional headers are set to enable cross-site resource sharing 
  if the CROSSSITEDOMAIN variable is set.
- Apache configuration files in Docker are configured differently;
  existing site configuration files will not be overwritten and 
  configuration options are now implemented as Apache variables.
- `DAList` objects now work with the `+` operator; a regular list can
  be added to a `DAList` but not the other way around.

### Fixed
- The `uncheck others` feature triggered an error if it was not the
  last field.

## [0.1.98](https://github.com/jhpyle/docassemble/releases/tag/v0.1.98) - 2017-11-20

### Changed
- Going to "/exit" will now log out the user, if the user is logged
  in.
- When using `&json=1` for JSON responses, the `interface()` function
  will return `'json'`.

### Added
- Action for `logout`, which works like `exit` but also logs the user out.

### Fixed
- Default values in object choices.

  `asset`, and `expense` attributes, but there are `objects` blocks in
  basic-questions.yml that will initialize these attributes.

  attribute, unless `offices` is provided as a keyword parameter
  during object construction.

### Changed
- The Markdown to HTML converter now uses the Attribute Lists extension.

- When the server is not in `debug` mode, users must be logged in as

  interviews in these packages are always inoperable unless the server
  is in `debug` mode.

### Fixed
- The `server_capabilities()` was not recognizing the `enable`

## [0.1.91](https://github.com/jhpyle/docassemble/releases/tag/v0.1.91) - 2017-11-07

  on the server file system and updated when they change.
- When using the Playground and S3 or Azure Blob Storage is in use,
  and there are more than ten decorations, no preview images will be
  shown in "Variables, etc."
- The values of `SavedFile` objects will be cached in memory for the
  duration of a web request, so that when you create a new
  `SavedFile`, attributes will be set from memory.
- The first argument to a `MachineLearner` object will no longer be
  used as a literal `group_id`.  Rather, an argument `'fruit'` it will
  be converted into a group_id of the form

  You can still set a literal `group_id` using the keyword parameter 
  `group_id`.
- When an `initial_file` is given to a `MachineLearner` object, two
  different formats can be used: an array, or a dictionary of arrays.
  If a dictionary of arrays, the keys will be checked and if the key
  matches the `group_id` (with the part before the final
  colon, if any, removed), the array corresponding to that key will be
  used.

### Fixed

- In addition, the way that questions are asked has changed
  accordingly.  If any fields that would be set by the question have
  attributes, **docassemble** will try to ensure that the underlying
  variable is already defined, which may trigger a process of defining
  the variable.  This will ensure that objects mentioned in object
  blocks will be created before they are necessary.

 `objects` blocks.

## [0.1.37](https://github.com/jhpyle/docassemble/releases/tag/v0.1.37) - 2017-08-16

### Changed
- Fields with `datatype: checkboxes` now have a "None of the above"
  option by default, and input validation ensures that something is
  checked.  The `none of the above` field modifer configures it.
- After registration, users will bypass the "Interviews" screen and
  go right back to their interview, if they have started an interview.

### Added
- Option in `fields` called `uncheck others` when `datatype` is
  `yesno`, `noyes`, `yesnowide`, or `noyeswide`.  Enables a yes/no
  field to act as a "None of the above" option.
- "Upgrade docassemble" button on the "Update a package" page.

### Fixed
- Automatic login after registration was not working, so users had to
  enter username and password information twice.
- Improved CSS for when name of interview on mobile is too long to fit
  in navigation bar.
- Non-ASCII characters in PDF fields when scanning through utilities
  no longer cause an error.
- Fixed problem introduced in 0.1.22 where interview data would be
  destroyed when switching back to an interview during the same session.

## [0.1.36](https://github.com/jhpyle/docassemble/releases/tag/v0.1.36) - 2017-08-13

### Fixed
- Small typo that made 0.1.35 unusable.

## [0.1.35](https://github.com/jhpyle/docassemble/releases/tag/v0.1.35) - 2017-08-13

### Added
- Support for help text next to choices in a multiple choice list.

### Changed
- Database upgrades now handled by alembic by default.  See the 'use
  alembic' configuration directive.
- Extension packages no longer depend on the docassemble.base or
  docassemble.webapp packages.  As a result, installation of an
  extension package will no longer trigger a total software update.
  If you want to upgrade docassemble, upgrade docassemble.webapp.
  Note that packages created in earlier versions will still have these
  dependencies until they are regenerated in the Playground.  You can
  always edit `install_requires` in the setup.py file.

### Fixed
- Bug fixes to SMS interface.

### Fixed
- Backwards compatibility for interviews started before `nav` added as
  a variable in the user dictionary.
- Extension packages now depend on `docassemble.webapp` so that when a
  package is updated, all of docassemble is updated, not just
  `docassemble.base`.
