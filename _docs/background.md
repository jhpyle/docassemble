Usually, your interview [code] runs whenever the user is "between
screens."  The process goes like this:

1. The user submits information from a **docassemble** screen (e.g.,
   by pressing the "Continue" button).
2. The user's device sends information to the **docassemble** server.
3. The server updates the interview variables based on that information.
4. The server then [evaluates the interview], using the updated
   interview variables, which may cause [code] to be run.
4. The server sends a new screen back to the user's device.
5. The user sees the new screen.

You may find this process too limiting for you as an interview developer
if you want your [code] to run at other times.

For example:

1. If your code takes a very long time to run, the user will have to
   wait, looking at a spinner.  For example, your code may trigger a
   factual investigation process that retrieves information from a
   variety of sources on the internet, which takes a long time to
   retrieve and process.  The user may think the interview crashed
   when in fact it is hard at work.  It would be better if the
   code could run in the background while the user continues to
   interact with the interview.
2. You may want to process the user's input before the user presses
   the "Continue" button.  For example, when you conduct an interview
   in real life, you can interrupt the interviewee if he or she goes
   off on a tangent.  You may want to do the same in an electronic
   interview.  If your interview processes information that users type
   into a [large text box], your users might spend a great deal of
   time typing their life story into the text box, when the first
   sentence of the user's narrative would suffice.  If your interview
   could process the user's input as they are typing it, similar to
   the way Google gives you search suggestions as you are typing, you
   could return feedback to the user as they are typing, letting them
   know that they can stop typing.
3. If your interview guides a user through a process that lasts
   several months, you might want your interview to send an e-mail to
   the user on a particular date in the future to remind them about
   something.
4. You may want your interview to take an action triggered not by the
   user logging in, but by the receipt of an e-mail.

There are features in **docassemble** that address each of these
needs.

1. If you have [`code`] that takes a long time to run, you can run it
   in a [background process].
2. If you want to process user input before the user submits it, you
   can cause the user's web browser to [check in] with the server
   every few seconds and update the user's screen with the results.
3. If you want to schedule [`code`] to run at times when the user is
   not using **docassemble**, you can create a [scheduled task].
4. If you want to allow people to send e-mails to your interview, you
   can provide users with a special e-mail address that processes
   [e-mail messages] and saves the results as an interview variable.

The following sections explain these features.

# <a name="background"></a>Background processes for time-consuming code

If you include code in your interview that takes a long time to run,
such as code that looks up information in an on-line database, the
screen will take a long time to load and the user may think that the
application has "crashed" when it is actually just working normally.

To get around this problem, **docassemble** allows interview developers
to run code in "background processes."  While the user is answering
other questions, or looking at a user-friendly screen that instructs
the user to wait, the **docassemble** server can be hard at work
carrying out time-consuming tasks for the user.

These processes can even operate in parallel.  For example, if your
interview searches the user's name in four different on-line
databases, all of these searches can be carried out simultaneously,
which will return a result to the user much faster than if the
searches were carried out one after the other.

**docassemble** runs these background tasks using [Celery], a
"distributed task queue" system.  [Celery] is highly scalable.  If you
are running **docassemble** on a single server and an interview starts
100 tasks at the same time, [Celery] will will queue the tasks and
handle them in order, working on several of them at a time.  And if
background tasks are particularly important for your application, you
can install [multiple servers] dedicated to handling these tasks.

To run code in the background, use the [`background_action()`]
function in combination with [`background_response()`] or
[`background_response_action()`].  When code runs in the background,
it runs inside of a [Celery] task, and any log messages or error
messages are written to the `worker.log` file.

The next subsections explain how these functions work.

## <a name="background_action"></a>background_action()

Here is an example that uses a background task to add a user-supplied
number to 553 and return the result.  (Of course, adding two numbers
is not time-consuming and does not need to run in the background --
this is just a demonstration!)

{% include side-by-side.html demo="background_action" %}

Briefly, here is what happens in this interview.

1. The interview tries to [evaluate] the [`mandatory`] block.  The
   variable `the_task` is undefined, so the interview tries to define
   it by running [`background_action()`].  However, the interview
   finds that `value_to_add` is undefined, so it asks the user "How
   much shall I add to 553?"
2. The next time the interview is evaluated, [`background_action()`]
   runs successfully because `value_to_add` is now defined.  The
   [`background_action()`] function starts an [action] running in the
   background that adds `value_to_add` to the number 553.  The
   variable `the_task`, representing the status of the background task,
   is defined.
3. The call to `the_task.ready()` returns `False` because the task has
   not been completed yet, so the `waiting_screen` is shown.
4. Since the `waiting_screen` has the [`reload` modifier] set, the
   screen reloads after ten seconds.
5. In the meantime, the `bg_task` [action] is running in the
   background and finishes the calculation.
6. The next time the screen loads, `the_task.ready()` will return
   `True`, and the `final_screen` will be shown.  The `final_screen`
   question calls `the_task.get()` to retrieve the calculated value.

Starting a background process involves calling the
`background_action()` function.

{% highlight yaml %}
---
code: |
  the_task = background_action('bg_task', additional=value_to_add)
---
{% endhighlight %}

The first argument to [`background_action()`], `bg_task`, is the name
of an [action] available in the interview.  Notice that the next block
is identified with `event: bg_task`; this is the block that contains
the code you want to run in the background.

There is an optional second argument to [`background_action()`], not
used in this example, which indicates how the result of the [action]
should be communicated to the user.  Omitting the second argument or
setting it to `None` means no communication (more on this setting
[below](#ui_notification)).

The keyword argument, `additional`, is passed to the [action] (and
the value can be retrieved using [`action_argument()`]).  You can
include as many keyword arguments as you want, called anything you want.
You can also have no keyword arguments at all.

The `background_action()` function returns an object that represents a
[Celery] "task."  In this example, the object is saved to a variable
called `the_task`.  This variable can be used in the following ways:

* `the_task.ready()` returns `True` if the task has been completed
  yet, and `False` if not.
* `the_task.failed()` returns `True` if the task raised an exception,
  and `False` if not.
* `the_task.wait()` will wait until the background task completes and
  then return `True`.
* `the_task.get()` returns the result of the task.  If the task has
  not been completed yet, the system will wait until the task is
  completed and then return the result of the task.
* `the_task.result()` is like `.get()`, except it returns an object
  containing details about the result of the task.  This is useful
  primarily if the task ended prematurely because an exception was
  raised.  The attributes of the object are:
    * `error_type` - the name of the exception object (e.g.,
      `IndexError`).
    * `error_message` - the error message (in plain text).
    * `error_trace` - a [traceback] message (in plain text),
      which can be useful when debugging errors.
    * `variables` - a list of variable names that the interview had
      been seeking, in order from most recent to least recent.  This
      is useful if the task failed because a necessary variable was
      undefined; in that case, the first item in this list will be the
      name of this undefined variable.
* `the_task.revoke()` will terminate the task. If you only want to
  remove the task from the queue if it has not started running yet,
  you can set the optional keyword argument `terminate` to `False`.

[Celery] will start trying to run the `bg_task` [action] as soon as
possible after `background_action()` is called.  If a lot of other
tasks are already running, the task will go into a queue and will be
run as soon as a [Celery] "worker" is available.

Regardless of how long the `bg_task` [action] takes to finish, the
`background_action()` function will always return a response right
away.  This means that when your interview starts a time-consuming
background task, the server will immediately present the user with a
new screen instead of making the user wait.  The `bg_task` [action]
will run in the background, independently of whatever goes on between
the user and the interview.  It will continue running even if the user
exits the browser.

The `bg_task` [action] runs in much the same way as an [action]
invoked by the user clicking on a hyperlink generated by
[`url_action()`].  (The parameters to `background_action()` will be
familiar to you if you have ever used [`url_action()`].)

{% highlight yaml %}
---
event: bg_task
code: |
  # This is where time-consuming code
  # would go
  background_response(553 + action_argument('additional'))
---
{% endhighlight %}

The code in a background action can use the [`action_argument()`] and
[`action_arguments()`] functions to access the [action] parameters
(i.e., the keyword arguments passed to [`background_action()`]).
It can use the [`user_logged_in()`], [`user_has_privilege()`], and
[`user_info()`] functions to determine information about the current
user (i.e. the user who caused the `background_action()` function to
be called).  In this respect, background actions are different from
[scheduled tasks], which always run as the special "[cron user]."  In
addition, background tasks are different from [scheduled tasks] in
that you can run background tasks regardless of whether [`multi_user`]
is set to `True` or `False`.

There are two important things to understand about [actions] invoked
through `background_action()`:

1. Background actions are not capable of asking the user any
   questions.  Before calling [`background_action()`], you need to
   make sure that all of the variables the [action] needs have been
   defined.
2. Any changes made to variables by a background action will not be
   remembered after the action finishes.  In order to communicate back
   to the interview, you need to use [`background_response()`] or
   [`background_response_action()`] (discussed below).

Your background action is prevented from saving changes to the
variables because background actions are intended to run at the same
time the user is answering questions in the interview.  For example,
if the background process starts at 3:05 p.m. and finishes at 3:10
p.m., but the user answers five questions between 3:05 p.m. and 3:10
p.m., the user's changes would be overwritten if the background
process saved its changes at 3:10 p.m.

The [`background_response()`] function is the simplest way to return a
value to the interview, but you may want to use
[`background_response_action()`] if you want to make permanent changes
to the interview variables based on the code that is run in the background.

Also, even if you are not interested in obtaining any results from the
background action, and are only interested in the action's side
effects, it is important that you end the [action] with a call to
`background_response()` (with no arguments).  Otherwise, the result of
the background action is likely to be an exception (if the interview
asks the user a question, this counts as an exception).

Note that any log messages or error messages generated by code that
runs in the background are written to the `worker.log` file, not the
`docassemble.log` file or the `error.log` file.

## <a name="background_response"></a>background_response()

The `background_response()` function terminates a background process
and returns information.  In can be called both from [background
tasks] and from [`check in`] code (which is explained later).  It does
different things depending on the context.

When called from a [background task], the information you give it can
be accessed from foreground code by using the `.get()` method on the
"task" that was created.

For example, in the interview above, the task is created like this:

{% highlight python %}
the_task = background_action('bg_task', additional=value_to_add)
{% endhighlight %}

There is now a variable `the_task` in the interview, which is used to
keep track of the status of the `bg_task` action, which is running in
the background.

The `bg_task` action does not permanently change any of the variables
in the interview, but it passes its result back to the interview using
`background_response()`.

{% highlight python %}
background_response(553 + action_argument('additional'))
{% endhighlight %}

The response value is the sum of 553 and whatever number was provided
in the `additional` parameter.  Note that this value is not saved to
any variable.  (Even if a background action _tried_ to make a change
to variables in the interview's dictionary, those changes would be
forgotten once the action completes.)

The interview can retrieve the value passed to `background_response()`
by calling the `.get()` method on the `the_task` variable.  For
example,

{% highlight yaml %}
question: |
  The answer is ${ the_task.get() }.
{% endhighlight %}

Note that once you call `background_response()`, your [`code`] block
stops executing.  No lines of code that come after your call to
`background_response()` will ever be run.

Your background task code should always end with a call to
`background_response()`.  Even if you don't need to return any
response to the foreground code, calling `background_response()` with
no arguments will safely wrap up your background task.  If your
[`code`] does not conclude with `background_response()`,
**docassemble** will attempt to run the [`initial`] and [`mandatory`]
blocks in your interview.  Depending on the context, this might be
harmless, or it might cause unwanted side effects.  At the very least,
you will probably get a warning message in the logs if your
[background task] concludes with an attempt to present a [`question`]
to the user.

The `background_response()` function is also used in the context of
[processing interim user input] (described [below](#check in)).  In
this context, it terminates `code` that runs on the server while the
user is looking at and interacting with a screen.

In this context, `background_response()` can be called in a variety of
ways.  (All of these methods are explained with examples in the
section on [processing interim user input].)

The first way that it can be used is to populate `[TARGET ...]` areas
on the screen.  If you only want to populate a single target area
(e.g., `[TARGET mytarget]`), run:

{% highlight python %}
background_response(target='mytarget', content='Hello, world!')
{% endhighlight %}

If you want to populate multiple target areas (e.g., `[TARGET top_area]` and
`[TARGET bottom_area]`), provide a list of dictionaries:

{% highlight python %}
background_response([{'target': 'top_area', 'content': "Hello, world!"}, {'target': 'bottom_area', 'content': 'Goodbye, world!'}])
{% endhighlight %}

Instead of writing HTML to areas of the screen, you can set the values
of input fields by calling `background_response()` with a dictionary
of field values, followed by `'fields'`:

{% highlight python %}
background_response({'favorite_fruit': 'apple', 'likes_vegetables': True}, 'fields')
{% endhighlight %}

The `background_response()` function can also be used to run
literal [JavaScript] in the user's browser:

{% highlight python %}
background_response('alert("hello world!")', 'javascript')
{% endhighlight %}

It can also be used to show an informational message at the top of the
user's screen:

{% highlight python %}
background_response('Hello, world', 'flash')
{% endhighlight %}

It can also cause a refresh of the user's screen:

{% highlight python %}
background_response('refresh')
{% endhighlight %}

When using these, make sure to avoid a situation where your code gets
into an infinite loop and the `check in` task runs multiple times per
second.  A `check in` call happens frequently: when the screen loads,
when a [change] event is triggered on an input element, and every six
seconds.  If your `background_response()` triggers a `check in` call,
which then runs `background_response()` again, there will be an
infinite loop.  Make sure to use the [JavaScript] console in your
browser when testing your use of `background_response()`.

## <a name="background_response_action"></a>background_response_action()

It is possible for long-running tasks to save information to the
interview's dictionary, but they need to do so by sending the
information to a separate "action," the purpose of which is to save
the information to the interview's dictionary.  The action is
triggered by calling the `background_response_action()` function.
Information can be passed to this [action] in the form of arguments.

{% include side-by-side.html demo="background_action_with_response_action" %}

In this example, the [action] that runs in the background is `bg_task`
and the action that changes the interview's dictionary is `bg_resp`.

{% highlight yaml %}
---
event: bg_task
code: |
  value = 553 + action_argument('additional')
  background_response_action('bg_resp', ans=value)
---
event: bg_resp
code: |
  answer = action_argument('ans')
  background_response()
---
{% endhighlight %}

The `bg_task` action finishes by calling
`background_response_action('bg_resp', ans=value)`.
(`background_response_action()`, like other functions including
[`background_response()`], [`message()`], [`command()`], and
[`response()`], tells **docassemble** to stop whatever it is doing.
**docassemble** will not process any code that follows
`background_response_action()` in a [`code`] block.)

The first argument to `background_response_action()` is the name of
the [action] to be run, and the remainder of the arguments are keyword
arguments that are sent to the action.  In the above example, The
`bg_resp` action retrieves the argument `ans` and changes the variable
`answer` in the interview's dictionary to the value of the `ans` argument.

The idea here is that `bg_task` is a long-running task, while
`bg_resp` is a short-running task devoted only to saving specific
results of the long-running task.  The brief [action] does not
interfere with the ongoing interview; it simply retrieves the
dictionary from storage, makes some specific changes, and then saves
the dictionary to storage.

When the code for the `bg_resp` action runs, it runs separately from
the `bg_task` action.  If `bg_task` changes a variable in the
interview's dictionary, the `bg_resp` action will not be able to see
those changes.  The only way the `bg_task` action can send information
to the `bg_resp` action is by passing arguments to it via the
`background_response_action()` function.

In computer programming terminology, the `bg_resp` action is similar to a
[callback function].

The `bg_resp` action ends with `background_response()` to indicate that
the action has run successfully and nothing further needs to be done.
It is important that the action end with a call to
[`background_response()`] because if it did not end with this, the
interview code would continue to be processed (just as it would with a
regular [action]), which may generate an error or cause unwanted side
effects.

If you call `background_response()` with an argument, the value of the
argument will be available in your interview as the result of
`the_task.get()`.  You probably will not need to pass values this way,
since you can communicate results by setting interview variables.

## <a name="background_error_action"></a>background_error_action()

If your long-running background process ends with an error, such as a
[Python] computation error, or a situation where a necessary variable
is undefined, an error will be printed to the `worker.log` file.  But
you might want your interview to do something special in response to
this circumstance.  For example, you might want an e-mail to be sent
to an administrator so that someone can fix a problem right away.  Or
you might want to make a record in the interview dictionary regarding
what went wrong with the background task.

One way to intercept errors is to use [Python]'s [`try`/`except`]
logic.  However, this can be tricky because **docassemble** uses
[Python]'s exception system to execute [`code`] blocks and process
[`template`]s, so some error types should not be intercepted
(e.g. `NameError`).  You can use [`try`/`except`] to trap specific
error types, if you know what errors are likely to happen.  But if you
don't know what errors your code will encounter, this might not be
feasible.

Another way to handle errors gracefully in a background process is to
use the `background_error_action()` function.  This function allows
you to specify an [action] that should be run in case the background
process fails for any reason.  For example, the following code will
run the `bg_failure` action if the background task runs into an error.
In this case, there will be a "divide by zero" error if the user sets
the "Denominator" to zero.

{% include side-by-side.html demo="background-error-action-demo" %}

In this example, `background_error_action()` is called, before the
`bg_task` block does its work, in order to tell **docassemble** that
if the `bg_task` action results in an error, the `bg_failure`
[action] should be run.  If `bg_task` succeeds in running to
completion, it ends with a call to [`background_response_action()`],
which will run the `bg_success` action.

The `bg_success` and `bg_failure` [action]s are effectively two
[callback function]s, one of which runs on success and one of which
runs on failure.  The ways that each operates are very similar.  While
the changes that `bg_task` makes to the interview's dictionary will
not be saved, the changes that `bg_success` and `bg_failure` make will
be saved.  While `bg_task` may take a long time, `bg_success` and
`bg_failure` should be designed to finish their work promptly.

When you call `background_error_action()`, you can specify arguments,
much as you can specify arguments when you call
[`background_response_action()`].  You might wish to use arguments to
indicate in what context an error took place.

Another similarity with [`background_response_action()`] is that
within an [action] specified by `background_error_action()`, you can
use `background_response()` to return a response value back to the
interview.  This value can be retrieved using the `.get()` method on
the task object.

One difference between an [action] specified by
`background_error_action()` and an [action] specified by
[`background_response_action()`] is that when an "error" [action] is
run, **docassemble** will pass additional arguments to the [action],
which contain information about the error.  These arguments are:

* `error_type` - contains the name of the exception object (e.g.,
  `IndexError`).
* `error_message` - contains the error message (in plain text).
* `error_trace` - contains a [traceback] message (in plain text)
  that can be useful in debugging.
* `variables` - contains a list of variable names that the interview had
  been seeking, in order from most recent to least recent.

(These arguments will override any existing arguments, so don't use
these names when indicating arguments in your call to
`background_error_action()`.)

The following interview illustrates these features.

{% include side-by-side.html demo="background-error-action" %}

## <a name="timing"></a>Timing issues

As soon as `background_action()` is called, a task goes into the
[celery] task queue.  If [celery] has an available "worker," the task
will start running right away.

If the task starts running while the interview is still running code,
the background task will wait for the interview code to save its work
before retrieving the interview dictionary and running the [action]
code.

Likewise, if the task finishes while the interview is still running
code, and the task ends with a call to
[`background_response_action()`], the "background response action"
will not run until the interview code is done processing.

This waiting is necessary to prevent concurrent processes from
stepping on each others' toes.  Note, however, that the waiting will
"time out" after four seconds.  For this reason, your interview code
and your "background response actions" should be designed to always
finish in well under four seconds.

This waiting also imposes some limitations on what you can do in your
interview code.  For example, if you are using
[`background_response_action()`] or [`background_error_action()`],
your interview code should never wait for the background task to
finish.  This means you should never:

* Call `.wait()` on the task object; or
* Call `.failed()`, `.get()` or `.response()` on the task object
  unless `.ready()` is `True`.

It is safe to wait for the background task to finish if you know that
your interview's background tasks do not use
[`background_response_action()`] or [`background_error_action()`].

Instead of using code to wait for a background task to finish, you can
use the [`reload` modifier] on a [`question`], or some other technique
where the waiting takes place while code is not running.

Also, because of timing issues, you cannot use methods on a task
object from code that runs in the background.  (All
[`code`] blocks indicated by [`background_action()`],
[`background_response_action()`], and [`background_error_action()`]
run in the background.)

## <a name="ui_notification"></a>Communicating results to the user interface

**docassemble** can automatically alert the user when a background job
finishes.  There are three ways this can be done.

The first way is to "flash" a message at the top of a user's screen.

The second way is to cause the user's screen to reload the interview
when the job finishes.  If you used [`background_response_action()`]
to change the interview's dictionary on the basis of work done by the
background process, then the user may see a different screen after the
interview reloads.  However, it is important to be mindful of the
users' perspective when using this feature; you would not want to
annoy users by refreshing their screens while they are in the middle
of entering information.

The third way is to cause the user's browser to run [JavaScript] code
produced by your background process.

The fourth way, if the screen has input fields in it, is to populate
those fields with values.

You can cause these responses by setting the second argument to
[`background_action()`] to `'flash'`, `'refresh'`, `'javascript'`, or
`'fields'`.  Setting the second argument to `None` means that no
notification of any kind will be sent to the user's browser.

In the following example, the value provided to
[`background_response()`] (e.g., "The answer is 555."), is
"flashed" at the top of the screen.

{% include side-by-side.html demo="background_action_flash" %}

You can also "flash" messages when you use
[`background_response_action()`] to run a separate [action]
that saves changes to the interview's dictionary.  In your action that
sets variables, conclude your code with a call to
[`background_response()`] containing the message you want to flash.

{% include side-by-side.html demo="background_response_action_flash" %}

In the next example, when the background process finishes, the user's
screen refreshes.  Since the [`background_response_action()`] function
was used to save the result of the background process to a variable
(`answer`), the result can be displayed by referring to `${ answer }`.

{% include side-by-side.html demo="background_action_refresh" %}

The next example is like the first, except the notification takes
place through [JavaScript] code created by the background process,
which in this case uses the built-in [JavaScript] function
[`alert()`] to send a message to the user.

{% include side-by-side.html demo="background_action_javascript" %}

Note that the user interface does not respond immediately when the
background task finishes.  The user's browser polls the server every
six seconds (edit [`checkin interval`] to adjust this).  Therefore,
users may experience up to a six-second delay after the background
process finishes before they receive notification.

The next example is like the previous, except that it populates fields
on the screen.

{% include side-by-side.html demo="background_action_fields" %}

<a name="assembly"></a>The following example shows how to assemble a
[document] in the background and then refresh the user's screen when
the document has been assembled.

{% include side-by-side.html demo="assemble-in-background" %}

Note that the variable `the_document` only comes into existence in the
background task, not in the interview itself.  The name of the file
that the interview uses is `the_letter`.  The name `the_document`
refers to a [`DAFileCollection`] object, which is passed from the
background task to the user interview, and in the user interview, the
object is known as `the_letter`.

## <a name="BackgroundAction"></a>The `BackgroundAction` class

The [`BackgroundAction`] class provides a way to launch a background
task and obtain its result using one method call.

{% include side-by-side.html demo="background_action_object" %}

The call to `bg.run()` looks like it is sychronous, but it is actually
asynchronous and results in the user's browser polling the server.

The source code of [`BackgroundAction`] is as follows.

{% highlight python %}
class BackgroundAction(DAObject):
    """Runs a background action or raises a wait command if the action is still running."""

    def init(self, *pargs, **kwargs):
        self._running = False
        self.refresh_seconds = 4
        super().init(*pargs, **kwargs)

    def run(self, action, **pargs):
        if not self._running:
            self.bg_action = background_action(action, **pargs)
            self._running = True
            self.initial_wait()
        if self._running:
            if not self.bg_action.ready():
                self.wait()
            result = self.bg_action.result()
            failed = self.bg_action.failed()
            del self.bg_action
            self._running = False
            if failed:
                return self.on_failure(result)
            return self.process_response(result)

    def initial_wait(self):
        command('wait', sleep=self.refresh_seconds)

    def wait(self):
        set_save_status('ignore')
        command('wait', sleep=self.refresh_seconds)

    def process_response(self, result):
        return result.value

    def on_failure(self, result):
        return result.value

    def running(self):
        return self._running

    def ready(self):
        if self._running:
            return self.bg_action.ready()
        return None
{% endhighlight %}

You can subclass `BackgroundAction` or borrow the idea of it for a
class of your own.

## <a name="cf_scheduled_tasks"></a>Comparison with scheduled tasks

**docassemble** also has a [scheduled tasks] feature, which is similar
to the [background processes] feature in that the code runs in the
background, without any direct interaction with the user.  The
[scheduled tasks] are different in that they are triggered at monthly,
weekly, daily, or hourly intervals, rather than being triggered by the
user.

Another difference is that [scheduled tasks] are always run by a
[special user], and this requires that server-side encryption be
disabled in the interview.  These restrictions do not apply to
[background processes].

# <a name="check in"></a>Processing interim user input

## <a name="check in communicating"></a>Communicating interim information to the interview

If you set the `check in` modifier on a [`question`], the user's
browser will "check in" with the interview every few seconds and run
the given [action].  The arguments to the action (which can be
retrieved with [`action_argument()`]) will be the current values of
the fields on the screen.

{% include side-by-side.html demo="check-in" %}

The value of `check in` is the name of the [action] that should be run
(in this case, `track_drafts`). Any changes made to the interview
variables during the [action] are saved.

The "check in" process takes place:

* Every six seconds, as well as
* Every time a [change] event takes place on an input element.  For
  text inputs, this happens when the "focus" leaves the text box, as
  it does when the user clicks outside the text box or presses the tab
  key.  The [change] event is not triggered from every keypress.

In the above example, a counter is incremented each time the browser
"checks in."  In addition, the current value of `favorite_food` is
tracked in a [Python set] called `drafts`.  The actual variable
`favorite_food` is not set until the user presses "Continue," but the
`track_drafts` code discovers the "draft" value by calling
[`action_argument()`].

Note that the values returned by `action_argument()` and
`action_arguments()` are raw, unprocessed strings that come directly
from the values of the HTML input elements, such as `'23.2', 'True',
'False', and ''. The values might not meet input validation
requirements.

Two special values can be retrieved with `action_argument()`:

* `_initial` will be `True` for the first `check in` request, and for
  all other requests will be `False`.
* `_changed` will be `None` for any periodic `check in` requests, and
  will be set to the name of a field for any `check in` requests that
  happen because a field was changed.

The `action_arguments()` dictionary does not contain these values;
they are only available by calling `action_argument()`.

Note that unlike [background tasks], [`code`] that runs from `check
in` **can** directly make permenent changes to the interview answers.
Because it has this privilege, [`code`] that runs from `check in` must
run quickly (in less than four seconds).

## <a name="target"></a>Updating the screen

You can also use `check in` to communicate information back to the
screen.

### <a name="target_template"></a>Template blocks

In the example above, [`check in`] referred to a [`code`] block.  In
the example below, [`check in`] refers to a [`template`] block.  The
`content` of the [`template`] is inserted into the user's screen in an
area designated by the [`template`]'s `target`.

{% include side-by-side.html demo="target-template" %}

If the user types "apples," the following message will appear:

{% include image.html alt="Real time feedback" src="target-template.png" %}

The timeline for this process is as follows:

1. When the screen is drawn, the `[TARGET feedback]` markup in the
   [`under`] text area of the question (the area underneath the
   "Continue" button) is converted into an invisible placeholder area
   identified by the keyword `feedback`.
2. The user types "apples" into the "Favorite food" field.
3. The browser "checks in" with the server, sending the values of all
   the fields on the page.
4. On the server, **docassemble** seeks a definition for
   `question_food`.  It finds a [`template`] that offers to define
   `question_food`.  This [`template`] has a `target`, so it will
   behave differently than ordinary [`template`]s.  Instead of setting
   the variable `question_food` to a [`DALazyTemplate`] object,
   **docassemble** will return the `content` to the browser,
   indicating that it is "targeted" for the area on the screen called
   `feedback`.
4. The web browser takes the content and plugs it into the invisible
   placeholder area identified by the keyword `feedback`.

If you want to run [`code`] and then use a [`template`] to communicate
results back to the user, just include a reference to the [`template`]
at the end of your [`code`]:

{% include side-by-side.html demo="target-code-template" %}

### <a name="background_response_target"></a>Populating targets with background_response()

Another way to send messages to the user's screen is to use [`code`]
to plug raw [HTML] into `[TARGET ...]` areas:

{% include side-by-side.html demo="target-code" %}

Calling [`background_response()`] with the keyword arguments `target`
and `content` will result in the `content` being plugged into the
user's screen in the `[TARGET ...]` area designated by the `target`
argument.  Unlike the method that uses [`template`]s, this method does
not convert [Markdown] to [HTML]; rather, the `content` is inserted as
raw [HTML].

If you want to plug text into more than one `[TARGET ...]` area, you
can do so by calling [`background_response()`] with a [list] of
[dict]s, where each [dict] has the keys `target` and `content`.

{% include side-by-side.html demo="target-code-multiple" %}

### <a name="background_response_fields"></a>Populating fields with background_response()

Another way to communicate results to the user's screen is to populate
input elements.  If you call `background_response()` with a
[dictionary] as the first parameter and `'fields'` as the second
parameter, the fields on the screen will be populated with the values
indicated in the dictionary.  The keys of the dictionary should be
variable names currently displaying on the screen (e.g., as they are
defined in the [`fields`] specifier).  The values of the dictionary
should be the values that you want the fields to have.  For example:

{% include side-by-side.html demo="ajax-calc" %}

### <a name="background_response_choices"></a>Populating dropdown choices with background_response()

You can also use the `'fields'` form of `background_response()` to
change the options in a dropdown list of a field on the screen. To do
this, call `background_response()` as though you are setting the value
of the dropdown field, but in place of the value, substitute a Python
dictionary with the keys `choices` and `value`. The `choices` key
should refer to a data structure containing the options that the
dropdown list will have. The `value` key is optional, but if it is
included it will cause the indicated value to be selected.

{% include side-by-side.html demo="country-state" %}

The data structure indicated by `choices` can be:

* a list of strings, in which case each string will be used as both
  the label and the value;
* a dictionary mapping values to labels;
* a list of single-item dictionaries mapping values to labels;
* a list of two-item lists, where the first item is the value and the
  second item is the label.

In this example, `choices` is being set to the output of
`states_list()`, which returns a Python `dict` that maps state
abbreviations to state names. Since there are some countries that do
not have states, it is possible that the Python `dict` will be
empty. If a dropdown field is required but has no choices, the user
will not be able to continue. In this example, the Python code
`or {'N/A': country_name(action_argument('country'))}` follows after
the call to `states_list()`, ensuring that there always at least one
choice.

When designing a screen like this, it is important to keep in mind the
different scenarios in which the screen might be shown, and to ensure
that the screen displays correctly in each context. The contexts
include:

1. The user arrives at the screen for the first time, and the Python
   variables `country` and `state` are undefined.
2. The user arrives at the screen by clicking the Back button on the
   next screen. In this scenario, the Python variables `country` and
   `state` are undefined, but **docassemble** will use the values the
   user previously entered as default values for the fields.
3. The user arrives at the screen as part of a review process, and the
   Python variables `country` and `state` are defined.

When the screen first loads, the "State" dropdown field is populated
with:

{% highlight python %}
states_list(country_code=showifdef('country', 'US', prior=True)) or ['N/A']
{% endhighlight %}

Obtaining the country code with [`showifdef()`] is important because
the country may or may not be defined. If the Python variable
`country` is not defined, the list of states for the country `'US'` is
used. If `states_list()` returns an empty dictionary, the `or ['N/A']`
ensures that there is at least one choice. It is important that the
the "State" dropdown is populated with one or more choices when the
screen first loads, because **docassemble**'s standard behavior when a
dropdown has no choices is to omit the field from the screen and
define the variable as `None` when the user presses "Continue."

When the user arrives at the screen for the first time, and the
"Country" field is not populated, the State dropdown will be disabled
due to `js enable if: val('country')`. When the user selects a
country, the `change` event on the Country field will be triggered,
causing the State dropdown to become enabled and the `check in` action
to run with the `_changed` argument set to `'country'`. When the
`check in` action returns a response to the browser, the list of
choices for the "State" field will be updated. Thus, it does not
matter what the initial choices of the "State" field are, since the
user will not see them. But it is important that there are initial
choices, because otherwise **docassemble** will assume that the field
should be omitted from the screen entirely.

The call to `showifdef()` uses the special `prior=True` keyword
parameter, which means that if the user arrived at the screen after
pressing the Back button, `showifdef()` will return the value of
`country` that the user had previously entered. This is important
because when the user arrives at the screen by pressing the Back
button, **docassemble** will populate the "Country" field with the
value of `country` that the user previously entered, and the list of
states should correspond with that `country`.

Note that `check in` code runs whenever any field on the screen
changes, and also runs every six seconds. To avoid unnecessary changes
to the screen, the `check in` code only returns a substantial response
if `action_argument('_changed') == 'country'`. It is important that
screen updates only happen at the particular times when you want them
to happen, because otherwise screen elements may update while the user
is interacting with them, resulting in a glitchy user experience.

As you can see from the above example, updating screens by making
asynchronous calls to the server is complicated. By using separate
screens to gather related variables, you can save yourself a lot of
time that could be put to a more productive use.

### <a name="background_response_flash"></a>Showing messages with background_response()

By setting the second parameter of `background_response()` to
`'flash'` and the first parameter to a message, you can "flash" a
message at the top of the user's screen.  In this example, a message
is flashed as soon as the user enters a favorite fruit.

{% include side-by-side.html demo="ajax-flash" %}

### <a name="background_response_javascript"></a>Running JavaScript with background_response()

Another way to communicate results to the user's screen is to use
[JavaScript].  If you call `background_response()` with some
[JavaScript] code (as text) as the first parameter and `'javascript'`
as the second parameter, the [JavaScript] code will be run in the browser.

{% include side-by-side.html demo="ajax-calc-javascript" %}

This example uses the [`flash()`] function in [JavaScript] to display
a message for the user.

See the [Javascript functions] section for more information about
things you can do with [JavaScript].

### <a name="background_response_refresh"></a>Refreshing the screen with background_response()

Another strategy is to use `check in` code to cause a refresh of the
user's screen.  If your `check in` code ends with
`background_response('refresh')`, the user's screen will reload the
[`question`] from the server.  The following example shows how you can
use this to dynamically update the list of choices in a radio button
list.

{% include side-by-side.html demo="ajax-refresh" %}

It is important that your `check in` code does not call
`background_response('refresh')` every single time it runs.
Otherwise, you will cause an infinite loop of screen refreshing.  In
this example, `background_response('refresh')` is only called when
necessary (when the value of `number_of_things` changes).

# <a name="scheduled"></a>Scheduled tasks

The "scheduled tasks" feature of **docassemble** allows your
interviews to do things when the user is not using the interview.

For example, if your interview guides a user through a legal process
that requires the user to file a document in court if the opposing
party does not respond within 20 days, your interview can send an
e-mail to the user after that 20 day period has expired, reminding the
user to resume the interview so that he or she can prepare the
appropriate legal document.

{% highlight yaml %}
mandatory: True
code: |
  allow_cron = True
  multi_user = True
---
initial: True
code: |
  process_action()
---
question: |
  When was the document filed?
fields:
  - Filing Date: filing_date
    datatype: date
---
question: |
  What is your e-mail address?
fields:
  - E-mail: email_address
    datatype: email
---
mandatory: True
question: |
  Ok, I'll e-mail you at ${ email_address} 20 days
  from ${ format_date(filing_date) }.
buttons:
  Leave: leave
---
template: reminder_email
subject: |
  Hey, it's been 20 days.
content: |
  Don't forget about that thing you need to do!
---
event: cron_daily
code: |
  if task_not_yet_performed('20 day reminder') and date_difference(starting=filing_date).days > 20:
    send_email(to=email_address, template=reminder_email, task='20 day reminder')
  response()
---
{% endhighlight %}

Let's go through this example step-by-step.

First, we set [`allow_cron`] to `True`, which allows scheduled tasks to
run, and we set [`multi_user`] to `True`, which disables
[server-side encryption].  (We need to disable this feature so that
the computer can access the interview when the user is not logged in.
The user's data is still secure; it just does not have the layer of
additional security provided by server-side encryption.)

{% highlight yaml %}
---
mandatory: True
code: |
  allow_cron = True
  multi_user = True
---
{% endhighlight %}

Next, there are three standard [`question`]s that gather the
`filing_date` and `email_address` variables and present a "final"
screen to the user.  Note that on the final screen, there is no
[`exit`] button, only a [`leave`] button.  If the user clicked an
[`exit`] button, the interview session would be erased from the
server.  By contrast, clicking [`leave`] keeps the interview session
on the server.  This is important because we want the interview to
persist on the server.  We need the interview to exist twenty days
after the `filing_date` so that it can send the reminder e-mail.

{% highlight yaml %}
---
question: |
  When was the document filed?
fields:
  - Filing Date: filing_date
    datatype: date
---
question: |
  What is your e-mail address?
fields:
  - E-mail: email_address
    datatype: email
---
mandatory: True
question: |
  Ok, I'll e-mail you at ${ email_address} 20 days
  from ${ format_date(filing_date) }.
buttons:
  Leave: leave
---
{% endhighlight %}

After this, we define the [`template`] for the e-mail that will be sent.

{% highlight yaml %}
---
template: reminder_email
subject: |
  Hey, it's been 20 days.
content: |
  Don't forget about that thing you need to do!
---
{% endhighlight %}

Finally, we get to the "scheduled task."  The [`event`] line
designates the [special variable]<span></span> [`cron_daily`].  This
code will run once per day.

{% highlight yaml %}
---
event: cron_daily
code: |
  if task_not_yet_performed('20 day reminder') and date_difference(starting=filing_date).days > 20:
    send_email(to=email_address, template=reminder_email, task='20 day reminder')
  response()
---
{% endhighlight %}

The first thing the code does (wisely) is question whether the e-mail
reminder has already been sent.  If the e-mail has already been sent,
it would be annoying to send the same e-mail again, every single day,
so we prevent that from happening.  (The [`task_not_yet_performed()`]
function is part of **docassemble**'s [task system].)

Next, the code evaluates whether the 20 day period has passed, using
the [`date_difference()`] function.  If at least 20 days have passed,
the e-mail is sent.  The [`send_email()`] function marks the "task" as
"performed" if the e-mail successfully sends.

The [`response()`] function is necessary to indicate that the task has
finished.  If this is not included, the interview logic will be
evaluated after the [`code`] block finishes.  In some cases, this will
be what you want, but in most cases this is not what you want.

In the context of the web application, the [`response()`] function
stops code execution and returns an HTTP response to the browser, but
in the context of a scheduled task, it merely stops code execution.
If you pass text to [`response()`], the text will be printed to the
output.

By default, any changes made to the interview answers will be saved.
Thus, your scheduled task can affect what the user sees in the web
application.  However, if your code does not change the answers, or
you do not need the answers to be saved, you can call
`response(null=True)`.  This will tell **docassemble** not to save the
answers.  Doing this can help conserve system resources.  This
behavior of the [`response()`] function only works in the context of
scheduled tasks.

If you are using [Docker] and you want to access the log of output of
scheduled tasks, use [`docker exec`] to enter the container and look
at the file `/var/spool/mail/mail`.  The log consists of e-mail
messages.  You can also view these messages using the `mail` command.

## <a name="enabling"></a>Enabling scheduled tasks

Scheduled tasks need to be triggered by some external source.

<a name="cron_hourly"></a><a name="cron_daily"></a><a
name="cron_weekly"></a><a name="cron_monthly"></a>If you run
**docassemble** on [Docker], you do not have to worry about how the
scheduled tasks are triggered; the tasks operate automatically.  The
tasks enabled in the [Docker] setup are:

* `cron_hourly`
* `cron_daily`
* `cron_weekly`
* `cron_monthly`

If you are not using [Docker], you will have to set up a system of
running the [`docassemble.webapp.cron`] module at regular intervals.

On Linux, the trigger can be a script installed as part of the [cron]
system.  For example, a script in `/etc/cron.daily` could run:

{% highlight bash %}
python -m docassemble.webapp.cron -type cron_daily
{% endhighlight %}

A script in `/etc/cron.weekly` could run:

{% highlight bash %}
python -m docassemble.webapp.cron -type cron_weekly
{% endhighlight %}

(And so on.)

The details of how exactly this command should be invoked depend on
how you have [installed] **docassemble**.  For example, the command
should run under the same user as the web server, and if you have
installed Python using a [virtualenv], you need to invoke [Python]
appropriately.

Note that you can use any variable name you want in the `-type`
argument to the [`docassemble.webapp.cron`] module.  The variable name
is passed to the interview exactly as though it were the name of an
[action] given by [`url_action()`].

## <a name="cron"></a>What the "cron" module does

The [`docassemble.webapp.cron`] module does two things:

1. It cleans out inactive interviews if `-type` is `cron_daily`.
2. It runs scheduled tasks in interviews, invoking them as [actions].

### <a name="deleting"></a>Deleting interviews after a period of inactivity

If the type of scheduled task is `cron_daily`, the
[`docassemble.webapp.cron`] module will delete interviews that have
been inactive for 90 days or longer.  (This period can be
[configured].)  Activity is measured by whether the interview answers
have been updated within the period.  This applies to all interviews
stored in the system that have not yet been deleted.

Note that interviews can be deleted from the system two other ways:

1. When the user clicks an [`exit`] button; and
2. If the user goes to the Interviews page and clicks a "Delete"
   button next to a listed interview, or clicks "Delete all."

### <a name="running scheduled"></a>Running scheduled tasks

The [`docassemble.webapp.cron`] looks at every interview in the system
for which [server-side encryption] has been turned off.  (Disabling
[server-side encryption] is performed by setting the [`multi_user`]
variable in the interview to `True`).  The module then inspects the
interview data to see if [`allow_cron`] is set to `True`.  If is, it
will see if the interview uses the variable given with the `-type`
argument.  For example, if the type is [`cron_weekly`], the module
will check if the interview has a block that offers to define the
variable [`cron_weekly`].  If there is such a block, the module will
run the interview with the [action] `cron_weekly` (and no [action]
arguments).  Any changes made to the interview variables will be
saved.

Interviews containing scheduled tasks will run regularly, and the
interview variables will be updated.  This means that even if there is
no activity from the original user, there will appear to be regular
activity in the interview, which means that the [interview deletion]
feature will never delete such interviews.  Usually, it is a good
thing that the [interview deletion] feature does not automatically
delete interviews with scheduled tasks; you might have an interview
that does something after a period of several months have passed.

However, you might not want your interviews to run scheduled tasks
indefinitely.  For example, in the example interview above, the
interview will persist after the e-mail sends, and will stay on the
server forever.  The [`cron_daily`] code will run on a daily basis
forever, doing nothing useful.

To get around this problem, you can instruct your scheduled task to
delete the interview when it is no longer necessary to keep the
interview alive.  For example, you can include the following:

{% highlight yaml %}
---
event: cron_monthly
code: |
  if last_access_days() > 365:
    command('exit')
---
{% endhighlight %}

This will run on a monthly basis, and will use the
[`last_access_days()`] function to check whether interview has been
accessed by a real user (that is, a user other than the [cron user])
in the past year.  If it has not, the interview will [`exit`], meaning
that the interview will be deleted from the server.

## <a name="cron user"></a>The cron user

Scheduled tasks do not run as the user who started the interview; they
always run using the special "cron user."  Therefore, if you want your
scheduled task to send an e-mail to "the user," make sure you collect
the real user's e-mail address into a variable beforehand.  During the
operation of a scheduled task, a call to [`user_info()`] will retrieve
information about the "cron user," which is not what you want.

If your interview is a [multi-user interview], make sure that the
"cron user" is not inadvertently kicked out of your interview before
[`process_action()`] is run.  For example, an interview with this code
could prevent scheduled tasks from running:

{% highlight yaml %}
---
default role: organizer
code: |
  multi_user = True
  role = 'organizer'
  if introduction_made and participants_invited:
    if user_logged_in():
      if user_info().email == first_person_email:
        role = 'first_person'
      elif user_info().email == second_person_email:
        role = 'second_person'
---
initial: True
code: |
  if role != first_person' and not ready_for_other_people:
    say_goodbye_to_user
---
initial: True:
code: |
  process_action()
---
event: cron_daily
code: |
  do_something_important()
---
{% endhighlight %}

When the "cron user" accesses this interview, it will not be able to
run the `cron_daily` action, because it will immediately be presented
with the `say_goodbye_to_user` screen.

One way to get around this problem is to move the [`initial`]
<span></span> [`code`] block that runs [`process_action()`] so that it
appears before the block that runs `say_goodbye_to_user`:

{% highlight yaml %}
---
initial: True:
code: |
  process_action()
---
initial: True
code: |
  if role != first_person' and not ready_for_other_people:
    say_goodbye_to_user
---
{% endhighlight %}

However, this opens up the possibility that someone in the role of
`second_person` could run [actions] without being screened.  If this
is a problem, you could alternatively do:

{% highlight yaml %}
---
initial: True
code: |
  if (role != first_person' and not user_has_privilege('cron')) and not ready_for_other_people:
    say_goodbye_to_user
---
{% endhighlight %}

The "cron user" is the only user on the system with the [privilege] of
`cron`, so you can use the [`user_has_privilege()`] function to detect
whether the user is the "cron user."

## <a name="cron long"></a>Long-running scheduled tasks

If your scheduled tasks take more than a couple of seconds to run (for
example if they download information from the internet), then they
should run the long-running code as a [background task].  While the
scheduled task is running, the task holds the interview variables in
memory and writes them to the SQL server when it finishes.  If a user
accesses the interview through the web interface at the same time as
the schedule task is running, the user's changes to the interview
could be wiped out.  (The web interface will wait for four seconds if
it sees that the interview variables are in use, but after four
seconds have elapsed, it will assume the task that was using the
interview variables has failed, and it will start using the interview
variables.)

To run [`code`] in the background from within a scheduled task, just
combine what you have learned in the [scheduled tasks] section with
what you learned in the [background tasks] section.

{% highlight yaml %}
event: cron_daily
code: |
  background_action('long_task', None)
  response()
---
event: long_task
code: |
  result = do_something_time_consuming()
  background_response_action('finalize_long_task', result=result)
---
event: finalize_long_task
code: |
  the_status = action_argument('result')
  response()
{% endhighlight %}

# <a name="email"></a>E-mailing the interview

An interview can allow users to send e-mails to it.

Here is how it works:

* The interview calls [`interview_email()`] to obtain a unique e-mail
  address for the interview session, such as
  `kgjeir@help.example.com`, and shares that e-mail address with the
  user.
* When an e-mail is sent to `kgjeir@help.example.com`, the server
  stores the e-mail.
* The interview uses [`get_emails()`] to retrieve a list of e-mails
  that have been sent to `kgjeir@help.example.com`.

{% include side-by-side.html demo="email-to-case-simple" %}

In order for this feature to work, your server must be configured to
receive e-mails.  If you are using [Docker], this involves:
* Disabling any e-mail server already running on the [Docker] host.
* Including `-p 25:25 -p 465:465` in the `docker run` statement when
  you start your [Docker] container, so that communications to your
  server on [port 25] and [port 465] are forwarded to the [Docker]
  container;
* Setting the [MX record] for your domain to point to your server.
  (If you are using a [multi-server arrangement], make sure to point
  it specifically to the machine that operates with the `mail`
  container role);
* Ensuring that the firewall rules (a/k/a "security groups")
  protecting your server allow incoming connections on [port 25]
  and/or [port 465].
* Setting the [`incoming mail domain`] directive in the
  [configuration] to the e-mail domain you want to use, unless the
  domain you want to use for e-mailing is the same as the domain used
  for your web server ([`external hostname`]).

See the [e-mail setup] section of the [installation] instructions for
details about how the e-mail receiving feature works.

## <a name="code email"></a>Running code in the background when an e-mail arrives

If you want, you can set up your interview to run [`code`] in the
background whenever an e-mail is sent to one of your interview's
sessions.  This can be helpful if an e-mail arrives at a time when the
user is not using the interview, but the user may need to take action
based on the e-mail.

When an e-mail arrives, **docassemble** will attempt to run a
[background action] within the interview session.  The name of the
"action" will be [`incoming_email`] and it will have one keyword
argument, `email`, which will be a [`DAEmail`] object representing the
e-mail that was received.

Below is an example that uses a [background action] to process an
incoming e-mail.  The [background action] simply sets the interview
variable `email` to the e-mail itself (which is a [`DAEmail`] object).

{% include side-by-side.html demo="email-to-case" %}

Note that:

* Your interview must set [`multi_user`] to `True`.  Disabling
  server-side encryption for the interview session is necessary
  because if the user is not currently using the interview when the
  e-mail arrives, **docassemble** has no access to the user's
  password, which is the key that decrypts the interview variables.
  (The same limitation applies to [scheduled tasks].)
* Your interview needs a [`code`] block that will respond to an
  [action] by the name of [`incoming_email`] that has a keyword
  argument `email`.
* If it is necessary to make permanent changes to the interview
  variables as a result of processing the e-mail, the [`code`] that
  runs the [action] needs to use [`background_response_action()`] to
  call a separate [action], the sole purpose of which is to save
  values to variables.  When **docassemble** runs the
  [`incoming_email`] action, it is as though [`background_action()`]
  was called, which means that the only way to make permanent changes
  to the interview variables is through
  [`background_response_action()`].  This is helpful because the
  [`code`] that processes the incoming e-mail might take a long time
  to run.  For example, the code might call [`ocr_file()`] on each of
  the attachments.

If your interview uses [roles], note that the [`incoming_email`]
action will be run using the privileges and user identity of the user
who originally obtained the e-mail address from [`interview_email()`].
This is different from [scheduled tasks], which are run using the
privileges and user identity of the [cron user].
