# <a name="how"></a>How docassemble uses objects

[Python] allows [object-oriented programming] and so does
**docassemble**.

Object-oriented programming can seem complicated at first, but it
actually makes programming much easier.  For an easy-to-read
introduction to object-oriented programming, see [Object-oriented
Programming for Document Assembly Developers] by [Quinten Steenhuis].

Here is a non-object-oriented way of saying hello to the user by name:

{% include side-by-side.html demo="hello-not-oop" %}

A better way is to define `user` as a **docassemble** object,
[`Individual`].

{% include side-by-side.html demo="hello-oop" %}

As explained in the [fields] section, variable names cannot contain
any punctuation other than the underscore.  So while `user_first_name`
is a valid variable name, `user.name.first` must be referring to
something different.  Periods in [Python] are used to refer to the
"attributes" of "objects."

An object is a special type of variable.  Rather than being a piece of
text, like `user_first_name` is, the variable `user` is an "object"
that is an "instance" of the "class" known as [`Individual`].

Using objects in **docassemble** requires a little bit of setup using
[initial blocks].  The [`objects`] block declares that `user` is an
instance of the class [`Individual`].

Objects have "attributes."  In the above example, `name` is an
attribute of the object `user`.  And `name` is itself an object (it is
an instance of the class [`IndividualName`], though you would need to
look at the [source code] to know that) with attributes `first` and
`last`.  The attributes `first` and `last` are not objects, but rather
pieces of text.  Anything before a `.` is an object, and anything
after the `.` is an attribute of the object.

Objects also have "methods," which are functions that return a value
based on the attributes of the object.  For example,
`user.age_in_years()` will return the current age of the `user` based
on the date defined in the attribute `user.birthdate`:

{% include side-by-side.html demo="age_in_years" %}

Methods are similar to attributes in that they are written with a `.`
before them.  The difference is that they run code to produce a value,
rather than simply accessing a stored value.  You can tell by the
presence of parentheses whether a method is being used.

Using objects in your interviews has a number of advantages over
using plain variables.

<a name="generic"></a>The first advantage is that you can write
[`generic object`] questions.  (See [modifiers] for documentation of
the [`generic object`] feature.)

For example, if you need to collect the phone numbers of three people,
the `grantor`, the `grantee`, and the `trustee`, you don't have to
write separate questions for `grantor.phone_number`,
`grantee.phone_number`, and `trustee.phone_number`.  You can write one
question to collect `x.phone_number`, where `x` is a "generic object"
that acts as a stand-in for any object of type `Individual`.

{% include side-by-side.html demo="generic-object-phone-number" %}

Any time **docassemble** needs to know the phone number of an
[`Individual`], this question will allow it to ask the appropriate question.

In the question text above, [`possessive()`] is a "method" that you can
use on any instance of the [`Individual`] class.  If `trustee`'s name is
Fred Smith, `trustee.possessive('phone number')` returns "Fred Smith's
phone number."  The method is pretty smart; `user.possessive('phone
number')` will return "your phone number."

Using objects also allows you to have different variables that refer
to the exact same thing.  For example, if `user` is already defined as
an object and you run this code:

{% highlight python %}
trustee = user
{% endhighlight %}

then you will define the variable `trustee` as being equivalent to the
`user` object.  `trustee.name.first` will always return the same thing
as `user.name.first`, and `trustee.phone_number` will always return
the same thing as `user.phone_number`.  In addition,
`trustee.possessive('phone number')` will return "your phone number."
You can write code that checks for the equivalence of objects, using
the `is` operator:

{% include side-by-side.html demo="user-is-trustee" %}

Object methods allow you to have a standard way of expressing
information even though the methods used to gather the information may
vary depending on the circumstances.  For example, the
[`age_in_years()`] method, discussed above, first looks to see if the
attribute `age` is defined, and if so will return that instead of
asking for the `birthdate` attribute:

{% include side-by-side.html demo="testage2" %}

Although objects are a fairly complicated concept, as you can see,
they allow you to write code that looks much like plain English.

In part, this is because objects allow you to do complicated things in
an implicit way.  For example, writing `${ grantee }` in a [Mako]
template will return the name of the grantee.  The interview
implicitly calls the method `__str()__` on `grantee`.
`grantee.__str()__` in turn calls `grantee.name.full()`, which strings
together the `grantee`'s full name from its constituent parts
(`name.first`, `name.middle`, `name.last`, and `name.suffix`), all but
the first of which are optional and will not be included if they are
not defined.

Note that object methods may depend upon particular attributes of
objects being defined.  If an attribute is needed but not defined,
**docassemble** will go looking for a `question` or `code` block that
defines the attribute.  For example, if you write this in a question:

{% highlight text %}
Remember that ${ trustee.possessive('phone number') } is
${ trustee.phone_number }.
{% endhighlight %}

then in order to ask the question, **docassemble** may ask you for the
trustee's name (so it can say "Remember that John Smith's phone number
is ..."), and then ask for the trustee's `phone_number` if it is not
already defined.

# <a name="stdclasses"></a>Standard docassemble classes

The classes in this section are automatically available for use in
**docassemble** interviews.

When you use objects from non-standard packages, you will need to
include a `modules` block to import the names from the package into
your interview, so that you can use the objects that are available
from that package.

Behind the scenes, the classes described in this section are part of
the [`docassemble.base.util`] module.  By default, a **docassemble**
interview will effectively add this to the top of your [YAML] file:

{% highlight yaml %}
modules:
  - docassemble.base.util
{% endhighlight %}

You can turn this off by setting [`suppress loading util`] to `True`.

If you are writing a [Python module], you will need to manually import
the class names from the [`docassemble.base.util`] module.  For
example, if you want to use the class [`Individual`], you would add
this to the top of your [Python module] file:

{% highlight python %}
from docassemble.base.util import Individual
{% endhighlight %}

## <a name="DAList"></a>DAList

A `DAList` acts like an ordinary [Python list], except that
**docassemble** can ask questions to define items of the list.

Here is a simple "Mad Libs" interview that uses `DAList`s to keep
track of words:

{% include side-by-side.html demo="madlibs" %}

The variable `i` is special.  When the interview encounters
`person[0]` and sees that it is undefined, it will go searching for a
question that offers to define `person[0]`.  If it does not find that,
it will generalize and look for a question that offers to define
`person[i]`.  If that is not found, it will generalize further and
look for a question that offers to define `x[i]`.  Thus, the one
[`generic object`] question, which defines `x[i]` where `x` is a
`DAList`, will ask all of the questions in the interview.

For another example, suppose you want to work with a list of
prospective recipients of an e-mail.  You could define `recipient` as
a `DAList` containing five [`Individual`]s

{% include side-by-side.html demo="testdalist" %}

This will result in the following five questions being asked:

* What is the name of the trustee?
* What is the name of the beneficiary?
* What is the name of the grantor?
* What is the name of the fourth recipient?
* What is the name of the fifth recipient?

<a name="DAList.appendObject"></a>The `DAList` operates like a [list]
in [Python], but it also has some special methods.  When adding a new
item to the list, you should use the **docassemble**-specific
`appendObject()` method.  This method is similar to the
`initializeAttribute()` method we discussed earlier.  Running
`recipient.appendObject(Individual)` creates a new object of the class
[`Individual`] and adds it to the list.  The `.appendObject()` method
returns the object it creates.  In the example above, the
first such object is the fourth item in the list, which means that the
intrinsic name of the new object is `recipient[3]`.  The result of
[`using()`] can be used in place of the name of a class.used as the
second parameter.

A `DAList` can be given a default object type, so that
`appendObject()` can be called without an argument.  This default
object type is controlled by the `.objectFunction` attribute.  For
example, when a `PartyList` object is created, the `.objectFunction`
attribute is set to [`Person`].

If you want greater control over the way the questions are asked, you
could add a [`generic object`] question that is specific to the
recipients that were added with `appendObject()`.  For example:

{% highlight yaml %}
generic object: DAList
question: |
  The ${ ordinal(i) } ${ x.object_name() } must have a name.  What is it?
fields:
  - First Name: x[i].name.first
  - Last Name: x[i].name.last
{% endhighlight %}

The names of the fourth and fifth recipients are capable of being
asked by this question, since the pattern `x[i]` (where `x[i]` is an
[`Individual`]) matches the intrinsic names `recipient[3]` and
`recipient[4]`.  Since the other [`generic object`] question, which
matches `x` (where `x` is an [`DAList`]) also matches `recipient[3]`
and `recipient[4]`, the order in which you list the questions in the
[YAML] file will determine which one is chosen.  Later-appearing questions
take precedence, so you would need to place the second [`generic
object`] question somewhere after the first [`generic object`] question
in order for it to be chosen.

Other methods available on a `DAList` are:

* <a name="DAList.append"></a>`append(item_to_append)` - adds
  `item_to_append` to the end of the list.  Just like the [Python
  list] method of the same name.  It takes an optional keyword
  argument `set_instance_name`.  If `set_instance_name` is `True`,
  then the object's intrinsic name will be changed to that of a member
  of the list (e.g., `my_list[2]`).  If `set_instance_name` is `False`
  (the default), then the object's instance name will not be changed.
* <a name="DAList.clear"></a><a name="DADict.clear"></a><a
  name="DASet.clear"></a>`clear()` - makes the list empty.
* <a name="DAList.sort"></a>`sort()` - reorders the elements of the
  list, saves the reordered items, runs `hook_after_gather()`, and
  returns the object.  If you pass keyword parameters to `sort()`,
  those parameters will be passed directly to Python's [`sorted()`]
  function.

{% include side-by-side.html demo="sort" %}

* <a name="DAList.sort_elements"></a>`sort_elements()` - acts like
  `sort()` but does not cause the list to be gathered.
* <a name="DAList.complete_elements"></a><a
  name="DADict.complete_elements"></a><a
  name="DASet.complete_elements"></a>`complete_elements()` - returns
  the subset of elements in the list that are "complete."  This is
  useful when you have a list of objects, and some objects are still
  in a nascent state, and you only want to use the objects that are
  "complete."  (See the discussion of `.complete_attribute` below.)
* <a name="DAList.gathered_and_complete"></a><a
  name="DADict.gathered_and_complete"></a><a
  name="DASet.gathered_and_complete"></a>`gathered_and_complete()` -
  this effectively re-runs the gathering logic on the list to make
  sure that the list is "complete."  This method is run automatically
  when editing a list item using a [`table`].  If `complete_attribute`
  is set to `'complete'`, this method will reset the "completeness" of
  each item before re-running the gathering logic.
* <a name="DAList.gathering_started"></a><a
  name="DADict.gathering_started"></a>`gathering_started()` - this
  returns `True` if the gathering process has started, or is complete;
  otherwise it returns `False`.
* <a name="DAList.set_object_type"></a><a
  name="DADict.set_object_type"></a>`set_object_type()` - when you
  use [Python] code to define the `object_type` attribute, call
  `.set_object_type()` instead of simply setting the `object_type`
  attribute.  `.set_object_type()` takes a single parameter, which can
  be the name of the class or a class name modified by `.using()`.
* <a name="DAList.extend"></a>`extend(extension_list)` - adds the
  items in the `extension_list` to the end of the list.  Just like the
  [Python list] method of the same name.
* <a name="DAList.index"></a>`index()` - given an item that exists
  in the list, returns the index number at which the item can be
  found.
* <a name="DAList.pop"></a>`pop()` - removes an item from the list.
  Just like the [Python list] method of the same name.
* <a name="DAList.insert"></a>`insert()` - inserts an item into the
  list.  Just like the [Python list] method of the same name.
* <a name="DAList.reverse"></a>`reverse()` - reverses the order of
  elements in the list, runs `hook_after_gather()`, and returns the
  object.  Just like the [Python list] method of the same name.
* <a name="DAList.count"></a>`count()` - returns the number of times a
  given item appears in the list.  Just like the [Python list] method
  of the same name.
* <a name="DAList.first"></a>`first()` - returns the first item of
  the list; error triggered if list is empty.
* <a name="DAList.last"></a>`last()` - returns the last item of the
  list; error triggered if list is empty.
* <a name="DAList.item"></a>`item(idx)` - if `fruit` is a `DAList`,
  `fruit.item(2)` is equivalent to `fruit[2]`, except that if `fruit`
  does not have an item `2`, the result will be empty text.  This is
  a helpful method in some contexts, such as fillable PDF forms.
  Empty text will also result if you try to use attributes on
  the result, so `fruit.item(2).seeds` or
  `fruit.item(2).total_value()` will also result in empty text.

{% include side-by-side.html demo="item" %}

* <a name="DAList.item_name"></a><a name="DADict.item_name"></a> `item_name(idx)`-
  returns the variable name for an item, given the item.  For example,
  `mylist.item_name(0)` returns `'mylist[0]'`.  This can be useful
  when calling functions like [`force_ask()`] and [`reconsider()`].
* <a name="DAList.delitem"></a> `delitem(idx, ...)`- Deletes
  one or more items by index number.  For example, `mylist.delitem(4,
  5)` deletes the fifth and sixth items from the list.
* <a name="DAList.does_verb"></a><a name="DADict.does_verb"></a><a
  name="DASet.does_verb"></a>`does_verb(verb)` - like the
  [`verb_present()`] function, except that it uses the singular or
  plural form depending on whether the list has more than one item or
  not.
* <a name="DAList.did_verb"></a><a name="DADict.did_verb"></a><a
  name="DASet.did_verb"></a>`did_verb(verb)` - like the `verb_past()`
  function, except that it uses the singular or plural form depending
  on whether the list has more than one item or not.
* <a name="DAList.as_singular_noun"></a><a
  name="DADict.as_singular_noun"></a><a
  name="DASet.as_singular_noun"></a>`as_singular_noun()` - if the
  variable name is `case.plaintiff`, returns `plaintiff`; if the
  variable name is `applicant`, returns `applicant`.
* <a name="DAList.as_noun"></a><a name="DADict.as_noun"></a><a
  name="DASet.as_noun"></a>`as_noun()` - if the variable name is
  `case.plaintiff`, returns `plaintiffs` or `plaintiff` depending on
  the number of items in the list; if the variable name is
  `applicant`, returns `applicants` or `applicant` depending on the
  number of items in the list.  You can also give this function any
  arbitrary noun and it will pluralize it or singularize it depending
  on whether the number of items in the list is more than one.  E.g.,
  `client.child.as_noun('kid')` will return `'kid'` or `'kids'`.
* <a name="DAList.number"></a><a name="DADict.number"></a><a
  name="DASet.number"></a>`number()` - returns the total number of
  items in the list.  If necessary it will trigger questions that
  ask for all of the items of the list to be populated.
* <a name="DAList.number_gathered"></a><a
  name="DADict.number_gathered"></a><a
  name="DASet.number_gathered"></a>`number_gathered()` - like
  `number()`, except it will not require that the list be fully
  gathered before returning a value.  It takes the optional keyword
  parameter `if_started`, which can be set to `True` if you want to
  trigger the start of the gathering process if gathering has not
  started.  Using `number_gathered()` with `if_started` can be helpful
  on `review` screens because it will prevent the item from being
  shown if list gathering has not started, but it will not prevent the
  item from being shown if list gathering has started.
* <a name="DAList.number_as_word"></a><a
  name="DADict.number_as_word"></a><a
  name="DASet.number_as_word"></a>`number_as_word()` - same as
  `number()`, except that the [`nice_number()`] function is applied to
  the result.
* <a name="DAList.current_index"></a>`current_index()` - similar to
  `number()`, except it returns the index value of the last item in
  the list.  If there is one item in the list, `current_index()`
  returns 0.  If there are two items, it returns 1.  If there are
  no items in the list, it returns 0.  This is useful in questions
  where an iterator `i` is not available, such as question that set
  `.new_object_type`.
* <a name="DAList.remove"></a>`remove(val, ...)` -
  removes the given items from the list, if they are in the list.
* <a name="DAList.comma_and_list"></a><a
  name="DADict.comma_and_list"></a><a
  name="DASet.comma_and_list"></a>`comma_and_list()` - returns the
  items of the list run through the [`comma_and_list()`] function.
* <a name="DAList.possessive"></a>`possessive()` - if the variable
  name is `plaintiff` and the parameter is `"fish"`, returns
  "plaintiff's fish" if there is one item in the list and "plaintiffs'
  fish" if there is more than one item in the list.
* <a name="DAList.pronoun"></a><a name="DADict.pronoun"></a><a
  name="DASet.pronoun"></a>`pronoun()` - returns a pronoun like "you,"
  "her," "him," or "them" "it", or "them," as appropriate, depending on the
  number of items in the list.
* <a name="DAList.pronoun_objective"></a><a
  name="DADict.pronoun_objective"></a><a
  name="DASet.pronoun_objective"></a>`pronoun_objective()` - for a
  `DAList`, this is the same as `pronoun()`.
* <a name="DAList.pronoun_possessive"></a><a
  name="DADict.pronoun_possessive"></a><a
  name="DASet.pronoun_possessive"></a>`pronoun_possessive()` - given a
  word like "fish," returns "her fish," "his fish," or "their fish,"
  as appropriate, depending on the number of items in the list.
* <a name="DAList.pronoun_subjective"></a><a
  name="DADict.pronoun_subjective"></a><a
  name="DASet.pronoun_subjective"></a>`pronoun_subjective()` - returns
  a pronoun like "you," "she," "he," or "they" as appropriate,
  depending on the number of items in the list.
* <a name="DAList.union"></a><a
  name="DADict.union"></a>`union(other_set)` - returns a [Python set]
  consisting of the items of current list, considered as a set,
  combined with the items of the `other_set`.
* <a name="DAList.intersection"></a><a
  name="DADict.intersection"></a>`intersection(other_set)` - returns a
  [Python set] consisting of the items of the current list, considered
  as a set, that also exist in the `other_set`.
* <a name="DAList.difference"></a><a
  name="DADict.difference"></a>`difference(other_set)` - returns a
  [Python set] consisting of the items of the current list, considered
  as a set, that do not exist in the `other_set`.
* <a name="DAList.isdisjoint"></a><a
  name="DADict.isdisjoint"></a>`isdisjoint(other_set)` - returns
  `True` if no items overlap between the current list, considered as a
  set, and the `other_set`.  Otherwise, returns `False`.
* <a name="DAList.issubset"></a><a
  name="DADict.issubset"></a>`issubset(other_set)` - returns `True` if
  the current list, considered as a set, is a subset of the
  `other_set`.  Otherwise, returns `False`.
* <a name="DAList.issuperset"></a><a
  name="DADict.issuperset"></a>`issuperset(other_set)` - returns
  `True` if the `other_set` is a subset of the current list,
  considered as a set.  Otherwise, returns `False`.
* <a name="DAList.gather"></a><a name="DADict.gather"></a><a
  name="DASet.gather"></a>`gather()` - causes the items of the list to
  be gathered and named.  Returns `True`.  Optional keyword parameters
  include `item_object_type`, which overrides the default
  `.object_type` attribute; `number`, which indicates a list length
  (overriding any `.target_number` attribute), `minimum`, which
  indicates a minimum number of items to gather (overriding the
  `.minimum_number` attribute), and `complete_attribute`, which
  indicates the attribute of an item that will be sought before an
  item is considered complete (overriding the `.complete_attribute`
  attribute).
* <a name="DAList.reset_gathered"></a><a name="DADict.reset_gathered"></a><a
  name="DASet.reset_gathered"></a>`reset_gathered()` - causes the
  list to be considered not-yet-gathered.  This can be used to query
  the user to add items to a list that may already be considered
  complete.  If called with the optional keyword argument `recursive`
  set to `True` (the default is `False`), the lists inside the list
  are also marked as not-yet-gathered.  If the `only_if_empty` keyword
  argument is `True`, then the list will be marked not-yet-gathered
  only if it is empty.  If the `mark_incomplete` keyword argument is
  `True`, and the list has a `complete_attribute`, then the
  `complete_attribute` of each item in the list will be undefined if
  it is defined.
* <a name="DAList.has_been_gathered"></a><a name="DADict.has_been_gathered"></a>
  <a name="DASet.has_been_gathered"></a>`has_been_gathered()` - returns
  `True` if the group has been gathered yet.  Does not trigger the
  gathering process.
* <a name="DAList.add_action"></a><a
  name="DADict.add_action"></a>`add_action()` - returns HTML for a
  button that adds a new item to the list.  This will set up a queue
  of actions for the user that will ensure that a new item will be
  added and its elements gathered.  See the [groups] section for
  details of how [`DAList`] and [`DADict`] gathering works.  By
  default, the text of the button is "Add an item" if the list is
  empty, and "Add another" if the list is non-empty.  The label can be
  overridden with the optional keyword parameter `label`.  The `label`
  passes through the [`word()`] function, so you can use the
  translation system to handle different languages.  If you set the
  optional keyword parameter `url_only` to `True`, the method will
  return only the URL for the action, not the HTML for a button.  You
  can change the color of the button to another [Bootstrap] color with
  the optional keyword parameter `color`.  The default color is
  `secondary`, or whatever the `add` value is under [`button colors`]
  in the [Configuration].  The size of the button can be changed with
  the optional keyword parameter `size`.  The options are `sm`, `md`,
  and `lg`.  The default is `sm`.  If you want the button to fill the
  width of its container, you can set the optional keyword parameter
  `block` to `True`.  The icon that appears in the button can be
  customized with the optional keyword parameter `icon`.  The default
  value is `plus-circle`, which refers to the [Font Awesome] icon `fas
  fa-plus-circle`.  It will assume you mean to refer to a "solid" icon
  unless you spell out the icon type with a full reference like `far
  fa-plus-circle`.  If you want to add your own CSS classes to the
  button, you can set them with the optional keyword parameter
  `classname`.
* <a name="DAList.item_actions"></a><a
  name="DADict.item_actions"></a>`item_actions()` - returns HTML for
  "Edit" and "Delete" buttons.  This method is primarily used
  internally; there are specifiers for [`table`] that control it.  It
  takes two positional parameters: the item itself
  (`the_group[the_index]`) and its index (`the_index`).  The remaining
  positional parameters, which are optional, are attribute names that
  should be edited when the user presses the "Edit" button.  For
  example, if you want the "Edit" button to show the user a screen for
  editing the `favorite_fruit` attribute, you would write
  `the_group.item_actions(the_group[the_index], the_index,
  'favorite_fruit')`.  If you wanted the "Edit" button to show two
  screens, one for editing the `favorite_fruit` attribute and one for
  editing the `name.first` attribute, you would write
  `the_group.item_actions(the_group[the_index], the_index,
  'favorite_fruit', 'name.first')`.  The `item_actions()` method also
  accepts the optional keyword parameters `edit` (defaults to `True`),
  `delete` (defaults to `True`), `reorder` (defaults to `False`),
  `ensure_complete` (defaults to `True`), `confirm` (defaults to
  `False`), `edit_url_only` (defaults to `False`), and
  `delete_url_only` (defaults to `False`).  If the value of `edit` is
  false, the edit button is not shown.  If the value of `delete` is
  false, the delete button is not shown.  If `reorder` is true,
  up/down buttons for reordering items are shown.  If
  `ensure_complete` is true, then after the user edits the attributes
  given as positional parameters, **docassemble** will run
  `.gathered_and_complete()` on the group.  If `confirm` is true, the
  user will be asked to confirm before an item is deleted.  The
  `edit_url_only` and `delete_url_only` parameters, if set to true,
  will alter the default output of `item_actions()` so that instead of
  outputting HTML of buttons, the method will output a single URL that
  can be used in the web interface as the URL of an edit button or a
  delete button, respectively.
* <a name="DAList._reorder_buttons"></a>`_reorder_buttons()` - This
  internal method can be subclassed in order to customize how
  reordering buttons appear in a table. See the source code for the
  code you will need to duplicate.
* <a name="DAList._edit_button"></a>`_edit_button()` - This internal
  method can be subclassed in order to customize how the Edit button
  appears in a table. See the source code for the code you will need
  to duplicate.
* <a name="DAList._delete_button"></a>`_delete_button()` - This
  internal method can be subclassed in order to customize how the
  Delete button appears in a table. See the source code for the code
  you will need to duplicate.
* <a name="DAList._add_action_button"></a>`_add_action_button()` -
  This internal method can be subclassed in order to customize how the
  `add_action()` button appears. See the source code for the code you
  will need to duplicate.
* <a name="DAList.hook_on_gather"></a><a
  name="DADict.hook_on_gather"></a>`hook_on_gather()` - this method is
  run automatically as part of the list gathering process.  It is run
  immediately before the `.gathered` attribute is set to `True` to
  mark the gathering process as finished.  If you use `.add_action()`,
  `.item_actions()`, or a feature that uses them ([table editing]),
  the `hook_on_gather()` method will run because these methods trigger
  the gathering process.  By default, `hook_on_gather()` does nothing,
  but it is useful in subclasses if you want to make sure that
  something is done before the list is considered gathered.  When you
  write `.hook_on_gather()` in subclasses, be careful that your code
  does not assume that the list has been gathered, because it has not
  been gathered.  For an example, see [using hooks].
* <a name="DAList.hook_after_gather"></a><a
  name="DADict.hook_after_gather"></a>`hook_after_gather()` - this
  method is run automatically as part of the list gathering process.
  It is run immediately after the `.gathered` attribute is set to
  `True` to mark the gathering process as finished.  If you use
  `.add_action()`, `.item_actions()`, or a feature that uses them
  ([table editing]), the `hook_on_gather()` method will run because
  these methods trigger the gathering process.  By default,
  `hook_after_gather()` does nothing, but it is useful in subclasses
  if you want to make sure that something is done after the list is
  gathered.  This method is different from `hook_on_gather()` because
  it is run after the list is gathered.  Thus, the method can rely on
  the list having been fully gathered.  However, because it runs after
  gathering is complete, `hook_after_gather()` should not trigger the
  asking of any [`question`]s or the running of any [`code`] blocks,
  because the logic will not be idempotent; there would be no reason
  in the for the `hook_after_gather()` method to be called again.  By
  contrast, the `hook_on_gather()` method can trigger the asking of
  [`question`]s or the running of [`code`] blocks, since the
  completion of `hook_on_gather()` is a prerequisite to the list being
  gathered.  In short, `hook_on_gather()` is a prerequisite, and
  `hook_after_gather()` is an afterthought.  For most purposes, you
  should be able to get by with `hook_on_gather()`, but one reason to
  use `hook_after_gather()` is if you have set `auto_gather` to
  `False`; in this case, `hook_on_gather()` is run before the
  `.gathered` attribute is sought, so it will be run before any code
  in a [`code`] block that defines the `.gathered` attribute.  You
  might want your logic to be applied after this code runs, not
  before.  For an example, see [using hooks].
* <a name="DAList.hook_on_remove"></a><a
  name="DADict.hook_on_remove"></a>`hook_on_remove()` - this method is
  called immediately before an item is removed from the list.  The
  item that is removed is passed to `hook_on_remove()` as a single
  positional parameter.
* <a name="DAList.hook_on_item_complete"></a><a
  name="DADict.hook_on_item_complete"></a><a
  name="DASet.hook_on_item_complete"></a>`hook_on_item_complete()` -
  this method is not currently called by the **docassemble** code
  under any circumstances, but it is a suggested method that you may
  want to implement in your subclasses and call in your interview
  logic. The idea is that your code would call this method immediately
  before setting the `complete_attribute` in order to trigger some
  standard procedure to run. E.g.,
  `my_list.hook_on_item_complete(my_list[i])`.
* <a name="DAList.filter"></a><a name="DASet.filter"></a>`filter()` -
  returns a [shallow copy] of the list object where the elements of
  the list are filtered according to criteria specified in keyword
  arguments.  For example, if `person` is a list of [`Individual`]s,
  and each individual has an attribute `is_witness` that is either
  `True` if the person is a witness and `False` otherwise, you can
  write `person.filter(is_witness=True)` to get a list of witnesses.
  This only works if the list is a list of objects.  By default, the
  list that is returned will have the same instance name as the
  original list, but you can change this by passing a single
  positional parameter.  Running `witness = person.filter('witness',
  is_witness=True)`, for example, will set `witness` to an object with
  the instance name `witness`.  However, note that the instance names
  of the elements of the list will not be changed.  While the
  `filter()` method can be a useful shorthand, its features are very
  limited.  In most situations, it is probably better to use a [list
  comprehension].
* <a name="DAList.initializeObject"></a>`initializeObject()` - Calling
  `my_list.initializeObject(0, DAObject)` will set the first item in
  the list to a `DAObject`, with an appropriate instance name.

If you refer to a list in a [Mako] template (e.g., `The applicants
include: ${ applicant }`) or convert it to text with the
[str() function] (e.g. (`str(applicant)`) in [Python] code, the result
will be the output of the `comma_and_list()` method.

The `DAList` uses the following attributes:

* <a name="object_type"></a>`object_type`: a class of type
  [`DAObject`] or subclass thereof, or `None`.  Initially, this is set
  to `None`.  If set to an object type, such as `DAObject` or
  `Individual`, then new items will be created as objects of this
  type.  You can also use the result of the [`using()`] method here.
* `gathered`: a boolean value, initially undefined.  It is set to
  `True` when all of the items of the list are defined.
* `elements`: a [Python list] containing the items of the list.  If
  this is set, the list will be considered gathered as soon as it is
  initialized.
* `set_instance_name`: this can be used in combination with
  `elements`.  If set to `True`, then when the `elements` are added to
  the list, their instrinsic names ([see above](#DAObject)) are
  changed to match the intrinsic name of the list.  For example, if
  you initialize `parties` as a `DAList` using `elements=[plaintiff,
  defendant]` and `set_instance_name=True`, then the name of
  `plaintiff` will be changed to `parties[0]` and the name of
  `defendant` will be changed to `parties[0]`.  The variables
  `plaintiff` and `defendant` will still exist, but if your interview
  refers to an undefined attribute `plaintiff.net_worth`, the
  interview will seek a definition of `parties[0].net_worth`.
* `there_are_any`: a boolean value, initially undefined, indicating
  whether any values should be gathered.  The expectation is that the
  interview will define a [question] or [code block] that defines this
  attribute.
* `there_is_another`: a boolean value, initially undefined, indicating
  whether there are any additional values that should be gathered.
* `auto_gather`: a boolean value, set to `True` by default, which
  indicates whether the interview should use the `.gather()` method to
  ask questions to gather the items of the list.
* `complete_attribute`: a text string indicating the name of an
  attribute of a list item.  If you have a [`DAList`] called
  `fruit` and you set `fruit.complete_attribute = 'weight'`, then
  when the `.gather()` method is gathering the items of the list, it
  will seek a definition of `fruit[i].weight` for every item of the
  list, as it is gathering the items of the list.  If you do not set a
  `complete_attribute`, the default behavior is to ask whatever
  questions are necessary to represent the list item as text.  See
  [using `complete_attribute`] for more information.
* `ask_object_type`: a boolean value, initially set to `False`.  This
  is used when you want to build a list of objects of diverse types.
  When `ask_object_type` is `True`, then when items are added to the
  list, **docassemble** will seek out a definition of the
  `new_object_type` attribute before adding an item to the list.  When
  it gets the object type, the object it adds to the list will be of
  this type.
* `new_object_type`: this works like `object_type`, except the
  attribute is undefined and a definition is sought every time an
  object is added to the list.  It is used in conjunction with the
  `ask_object_type` attribute.

For more information about gathering items using [`DAList`] objects,
see the section on [groups].

## <a name="DAObject"></a>DAObject

All **docassemble** objects are instances of the `DAObject` class.
`DAObject`s are different from normal [Python objects] because they
have special features that allow their attributes to be defined by
**docassemble** questions. If `fruit` is an ordinary [Python object]
and you refer to `fruit.seeds` when `seeds` is not an existing
attribute of `fruit`, [Python] will generate an [AttributeError].  But
if `fruit` is a `DAObject`, **docassemble** will intercept that error
and look for a [`question`], [`code`] block (or other block) that
offers to define `fruit.seeds`. Or, if that does not work, it will
look for a [`generic object`] block that offers to define `x.seeds`
for a `DAObject`.

From the interview developer's perspective, `DAObject`s can be treated
like ordinary [Python objects] in most ways, but there are exceptions.

### <a name="DAObject.instanceName"></a>Intrinsic names

An important characteristic of all [`DAObject`] instances is that they
have intrinsic names.  If you do:

{% highlight yaml %}
objects:
  - foo: DAObject
{% endhighlight %}

then `foo` will be an instance of the `DAObject` class and
`foo.instanceName` will be `'foo'`. The object knows its own name.
This is not a standard feature of [Python] objects, but a feature
added by **docassemble**.

In [Python], objects are created by calling the class as though it
were a function:

{% highlight python %}
>>> from decimal import Decimal
>>> salary = Decimal(20000)
>>> float(salary)
20000.0
{% endhighlight %}

In this example, `Decimal()` is called with a parameter representing
a number. Similarly, when you call `DAObject()` you provide a
parameter representing the name of the variable.

{% highlight python %}
from docassemble.base.util import DAObject

foo = DAObject('foo')
{% endhighlight %}

Since `foo` is a [Python] object, you can create other names
for the same object, but the `instanceName` attribute will not change.

{% highlight python %}
>>> from docassemble.base.util import DAObject
>>> foo = DAObject('foo')
>>> foo.instanceName
'foo'
>>> foo.seeds = 4
>>> foo.seeds
4
>>> bar = foo
>>> bar.instanceName
'foo'
>>> bar.seeds += 1
>>> foo.seeds
5
{% endhighlight %}

The fact that each [`DAObject`] has only one intrinsic name can lead
to confusion in interviews if you are not careful.  For example,
suppose you try the following:

{% include side-by-side.html demo="branch-error" %}

This will result in the following error:

> There was a reference to a variable 'long_branch.length' that could
> not be looked up in the question file or in any of the files
> incorporated by reference into the question file.
{: .blockquote}

You might think, "hey, why doesn't my interview ask the question that
sets `tree.branch.length`?"  The reason is that `tree.branch` is just
an alias for `long_branch`, and the object knows itself only as
`long_branch`.  Thus, when the interview needs a definition for the
`.length` attribute of this object, it will look for
`long_branch.length`.

If you had a question that defined `long_branch.length` or a
[`generic object`] question for the `x.length` where `x` is a
[`DAObject`], then the interview would use that question.  However,
the interview is not able to search for the length of the branch using
`tree.branch.length` since the intrinsic name of the object is
`long_branch`, not `tree.branch`.

This will work as intended:

{% include side-by-side.html demo="branch-no-error" %}

You also need to be careful about intrinsic names if you [write your
own functions].  For example, assume you wrote a [Python module]
containing:

{% highlight python %}
from docassemble.base.util import DAList, Thing

def build_list():
    the_list = DAList('the_list', object_type=Thing)
    for indexno in range(4):
        the_list.appendObject()
    return the_list
{% endhighlight %}

Assume you then created some lists in your interview:

{% highlight yaml %}
code: |
  list_of_fruits = build_list()
  list_of_vegetables = build_list()
{% endhighlight %}

The problem here is that the `list_of_fruits` and `list_of_vegetables`
objects, as well as their subobjects, will not have the right
intrinsic names.

In some situations, you can write `foo = DAObject()` instead of `foo =
DAObject('foo')`, and it will automatically figure out the instance
name, but this is fragile, and under certain circumstances it can
fail, and it will fall back to giving the object a random instrinsic
name.  To avoid this problem, you can always set the intrinsic name of
an object at the time you create it by passing the intrinsic name you
want to use as the first parameter.

Thus, you can do:

{% highlight python %}
def build_list(list_name):
    the_list = DAList(list_name, object_type=Thing)
    for indexno in range(4):
        the_list.appendObject()
    return the_list
{% endhighlight %}

And then this will work:

{% highlight yaml %}
code: |
  list_of_fruits = build_list('list_of_fruits')
  list_of_vegetables = build_list('list_of_vegetables')
{% endhighlight %}

The requirement of making sure your objects are aware of their names
is inconvenient, but necessary.  [Python] has no built-in system by
which a variable can know its own name.  In **docassemble**, it is
necessary for objects to know their own names so that when your
[interview logic] refers to an undefined object attribute, list element,
or dictionary key, **docassemble** knows what [`question`] or [`code`]
block to use to obtain a definition of the undefined variable.

One of the useful things about `DAObject`s is that you can write
[`generic object`] questions that work in a wide variety of
circumstances because the questions can use the variable name itself
when forming the text of the question to ask the user.

<a name="DAObject.object_name"></a>If you refer to a `DAObject` in a
[Mako] template (or reduce it to text with Python's [str() function]),
this will have the effect of calling the [`object_name()`] method,
which attempts to return a human-friendly name for the object.

For example:

{% include side-by-side.html demo="daobject" %}

Although there is only one question for `x.color`, this question
generates both "What is the color of the turnip?" and "What is the
color of the front gate in the park?"  This is because [`object_name()`]
is implicitly called and it turns `park.front_gate` into "front gate
in the park."

The [`object_name()`] method is multi-lingual-friendly.  By using
`docassemble.base.util.update_word_collection()`, you can provide
non-English translations for words that come from variable names, such
as "turnip," "park," and "front gate."  By using
[`docassemble.base.util.update_language_function()`], you can define a
non-English version of the `a_in_the_b()` function, which
[`object_name()`] uses to convert an attribute name like
`park.front_gate` into "front gate in the park."  (It calls
`a_in_the_b('front gate', 'park')`.)  So in a Spanish interview,
`park.front_gate.object_name()` would return "puerta de entrada en el
parque."  (The Spanish version of `a_in_the_b()` will be more
complicated than the English version because it will need to determine
the gender of the second argument.)

<a name="DAObject.object_possessive"></a>A related method of
`DAObject` is `object_possessive()`.  Calling
`turnip.object_possessive('leaves')` will return `the turnip's
leaves`. Calling `park.front_gate.object_possessive('latch')` will
return `the latch of the front gate in the park`.

The `DAObject` is the most basic object, and all other **docassemble**
objects inherit from it.  These objects will have different methods
and behaviors.  For example, if `friend` is an [`Individual`],
referring to `${ friend }` in a [Mako] template will not return
`friend.object_name()`; rather, it will return `friend.full_name()`,
which may require asking the user for the `friend`'s name.

### <a name="DAObject.initializeAttribute"></a> Methods for working with attributes

A [`DAObject`] can have any attributes you want to give it.  When
those attributes are objects themselves, you need to use the
`initializeAttribute()` method.

One way to initialize attributes of an object is to use [Python] code:

{% highlight yaml %}
objects:
  - fish: DAObject
---
code: |
  fish.best_friend = DAObject()
{% endhighlight %}

Under many circumstances, this works, and the variable on the left
will be assigned a correct `instanceName`.

However, **docassemble**'s system for setting the `instanceName`
in circumstances like this relies on hacking the internals of
[Python].  It is not guaranteed to work in all circumstances.  A safe
way to define attributes is as follows:

{% highlight yaml %}
objects:
  - fish: DAObject
---
sets: fish.best_friend
code: |
  fish.initializeAttribute('best_friend', DAObject)
{% endhighlight %}

The first argument to `initializeAttribute` is the attribute name, as
quoted text.  The second argument is the name of the object the
attribute should be (not quoted).

It is necessary to modify the [`code`] block with [`sets`] because
**docassemble** needs help figuring out that the code block
offers to define `fish.best_friend`.

The `initializeAttribute()` method returns the object it just
initialized.

<a name="DAObject.reInitializeAttribute"></a>The
[`initializeAttribute()`] method will have no effect if the attribute
is already defined.  If you want to force the setting of an attribute
in situations when the attribute is already defined, use
`reInitializeAttribute()` instead of [`initializeAttribute()`], and it
will overwrite the attribute.  The `reInitializeAttribute()` method
returns the object it just reinitialized.

The best way to define object attributes is to use the [`objects`]
block.

{% highlight yaml %}
objects:
  - fish: DAObject
  - fish.best_friend: DAObject
{% endhighlight %}

This also works with list items:

{% highlight yaml %}
objects: |
  - companies: DAList.using(object_type=Person)
  - companies[i].principal_place_of_business: City
{% endhighlight %}

You can also use [`objects`] with the [`generic object`] modifier:

{% highlight yaml %}
generic object: Person
objects: |
  - x.principal_place_of_business: City
{% endhighlight %}

This will ensure that the `principal_place_of_business` of an
[`Individual`] or [`Organization`] is always a [`City`].

The [`DAObject`] provides some convenience functions for working with
object attributes.

<a name="DAObject.attribute_defined"></a>The `attribute_defined()`
method will return `True` or `False` depending on whether the given
attribute is defined.  The attribute name must be provided as quoted
text.  For example:

{% highlight yaml %}
objects:
  - client: Individual
---
mandatory: True
question: |
  % if client.address.attribute_defined('city'):
  You live in ${ client.address.city }.
  % else:
  I don't know where you live.
  % endif
{% endhighlight %}

<a name="DAObject.attr"></a>The `attr()` method will return the value
of the given attribute.  The attribute must be provided as text.
(E.g., `client.address.attr('city')`.)  If the attribute is not
defined, `None` will be returned.  This can be useful if you have
several attributes but you want to access them programmatically.  For
example:

{% highlight yaml %}
mandatory: True
question: |
  Your address.
subquestion: |
  % for part in ['address', 'city', 'state', 'zip']:
  Your ${ part } is ${ client.address.attr(part) }.

  % endfor
{% endhighlight %}

Note that because `None` is returned when the attribute is not
defined, this method will not trigger a process of retrieving a
definition for the attribute.  If you want to trigger this process,
use the built-in [Python] function [`getattr()`].

{% highlight yaml %}
code: |
  for characteristic in ['eye_color', 'hair_color', 'weight']:
    getattr(client.child[i], characteristic)
  client.child[i].complete = True
{% endhighlight %}

As discussed below, the [`Individual`] object has interesting methods
related to pronouns.  These methods are universal, so you can use them
on any [`DAObject`].

<a name="DAObject.attr_name"></a>Sometimes, you need to refer to the
name of an attribute, rather than the attribute itself.  For example,
when passing variable names to `showif()` or `force_ask()`, you need
to refer to the names of variables as a text string, because if you
just referred to the variable itself, you would be passing its value
and the variable would need to be defined, which isn't what you want.

For example, if you do this:

{% highlight yaml %}
code: |
  force_ask(person[i].attr_name('birthdate'))
{% endhighlight %}

it will have the effect of doing:

{% highlight yaml %}
code: |
  force_ask(person[i].instanceName + '.birthdate')
{% endhighlight %}

In the case of the fourth `person` in the list, this has the effect of
doing:

{% highlight yaml %}
code: |
  force_ask('person[3].birthdate')
{% endhighlight %}

<a name="DAObject.delattr"></a>If you want to delete attributes of a
[`DAObject`], where the attributes may or may not be defined, you can
use the `delattr()` method.

{% highlight python %}
client.delattr('birthdate')
{% endhighlight %}

You can also give it multiple attribute names.

{% highlight yaml %}
client.delattr('birthdate', 'sibling_count')
{% endhighlight %}

<a name="DAObject.invalidate_attr"></a>The `invalidate_attr()` method
is like the `delattr()` method, except it remembers the values of the
attributes in order to present them as default values to the user when
the [`question`] that defines the attribute is asked again.

<a name="DAObject.getattr_fresh"></a>The `fresh_getattr()` method
takes the name of an attribute, calls [`reconsider()`] on the
attribute and then returns the value of the attribute.

{% highlight yaml %}
client.getattr_fresh('total_income')
{% endhighlight %}

This should only be used on attributes that are defined by `code`
blocks.

<a name="DAObject.raise_undefined_attribute_error"></a>The
`raise_undefined_attribute_error()` method raises the same type of
exception that a `DAObject` raises when the interview logic requires a
definition of an object attribute that is undefined.

This can be useful when you are using the `@property` decorator to
implement getter/setter methods.

{% highlight python %}
from docassemble.base.util import DAObject

__all__ = ['MyObject']

class MyObject(DAObject):

  @property
  def foo(self):
    if not hasattr(self, '_foo'):
      self.raise_undefined_attribute_error('foo')
    return self._foo

  @foo.setter
  def foo(self, val):
    self._foo = val

{% endhighlight %}

### <a name="DAObjectlang"></a>Language methods

<a name="DAObject.possessive"></a>The `possessive()` method is a
[language method] that responds with a possessive phrase. For example,
if the object `friend` when reduced to text returns `John Smith`, then
`friend.possessive('fish')` will return `John Smith's fish`.

<a name="DAObject.pronoun"></a><a
name="DAObject.pronoun_objective"></a><a
name="DAObject.pronoun_subjective"></a><a
name="DAObject.pronoun_possessive"></a>If the object is a generic
[`DAObject`], or a subclass of [`DAObject`] that does not have any
special pronoun behavior, then the `.pronoun()`,
`.pronoun_subjective()`, and `.pronoun_objective()` methods all return
`'it'`.  The `.pronoun_possessive()` method returns `'its'` followed
by the argument.  For example, `thing.pronoun_possessive('reason')`
returns `'its reason'`. These methods work differently on subclasses
[`Individual`] and [`DAList`]. See [language methods] for more
information.

<a name="DAObject.is_are_you"></a><a name="DAObject.yourself_or_name"></a><a name="DAObject.itself"></a><a name="DAObject.is_user"></a><a name="DAObject.do_question"></a><a name="DAObject.did_question"></a><a name="DAObject.were_question"></a><a name="DAObject.have_question"></a><a name="DAObject.does_verb"></a><a name="DAObject.did_verb"></a><a name="DAObject.subjective_pronoun_or_name"></a><a name="DAObject.pronoun_or_name"></a>The `DAObject` supports the
[language methods] `is_are_you()`, `yourself_or_name()`, `itself()`,
`is_user()`, `do_question()`, `did_question()`, `were_question()`,
`have_question()`, `does_verb()`, `did_verb()`,
`subjective_pronoun_or_name()`, `pronoun_or_name()`. For more
information about how to use these methods, see [language methods].

<a name="DAObject._point_of_view"></a><a
name="DAObject.get_point_of_view"></a>Many of the [language methods] of
the [DAObject] class accept the optional keyword parameter `person`,
which can be set to `1`, `2`, `3` to indicate that they should use
first person ("I," "me"), second person ("you", "your"), or
third person ("them," "their"). You can avoid passing this parameter
every time by setting the `._point_of_view` attribute of the object to
`1`, `2`, or `3`. You can also use plural forms `1p` ("we", "our") and
`2p` (which is the same as `2` in English).

### <a name="DAObjectutil"></a>Utility methods

<a name="DAObject.as_serializable"></a>The `.as_serializable()` method
returns a simplified representation of the object and its attributes.
Objects are converted to [Python dict]s, so that they can be
serialized to [JSON] or other formats.  The conversion is not
reversible, and much information cannot be converted.  Nevertheless,
this can be a useful way to convert the information in your objects
into a form that can be digested by non-Python-based systems.  See
also the [`all_variables()`] and [`set_variables()`] functions.

<a name="DAObject.copy_shallow"></a>The `copy_shallow()` method
creates a copy of the object and gives it a new intrinsic name.

{% highlight python %}
new_object = old_object.copy_shallow('new_object')
{% endhighlight %}

The copy is "shallow," which means that while `new_object` will be a
new object with its own separate existence, sub-objects of the new
object will simply be references to corresponding sub-objects of the
original object.

{% highlight python %}
>>> new_object is old_object
False
>>> new_object.sub_object is old_object.sub_object
True
{% endhighlight %}

{% include side-by-side.html demo="copy-shallow" %}

<a name="DAObject.copy_deep"></a>The `copy_deep()` method creates a
copy of the object its sub-objects and gives it, and all of its
sub-objects, new intrinsic names.

{% highlight python %}
new_object = old_object.copy_deep('new_object')
{% endhighlight %}

Because the copy is "deep," each sub-object has a separate existence:

{% highlight python %}
>>> new_object is old_object
False
>>> new_object.sub_object is old_object.sub_object
False
{% endhighlight %}

{% include side-by-side.html demo="copy-deep" %}

## <a name="DADict"></a><a name="DADict.initializeObject"></a>DADict

A `DADict` acts like a [Python dictionary] except that dictionary keys
and values can be defined through **docassemble** questions.

To add a value that is a new **docassemble** object, you need to call
the `initializeObject()` method.

For example:

{% include side-by-side.html demo="dadict" %}

The first parameter is the name of the attribute.  The second
parameter is the type of object.  The result of [`using()`] can be
used in place of the class name.

<a name="DADict.new"></a><a name="FinancialList.new"></a><a
name="PeriodicFinancialList.new"></a>The `DADict` also uses a similar
method called `.new()`.  This method initializes a new object and
makes it an entry in the dictionary.  For example, if the dictionary
is called `positions`, calling `positions.new('file clerk',
'supervisor')` will result in the creation of the object
`positions['file clerk']` and the object `positions['supervisor']`.
The type of object is given by the [`object_type`] attribute, or
[`DAObject`] if [`object_type`] is not set.  You can also pass a
[list] and it will unpack the list, initializing dictionary entries
for each value.

`DADict`s use the same attributes that [`DAList`]s use.  It also uses:

* `new_item_name`: a text value, initially undefined, indicating the
key of a new item being gathered into the dictionary.
* `new_item_value`: a value, initially undefined, indicating the value
of a new item being gathered into the dictionary.  This is only used
when the `.object_type` of the [`DADict`] is not set.

`DADict`s use the same methods that [`DAList`]s use, except for
`.appendObject()`, `.append()`, `.remove()`, `.discard()`,
`.extend()`, `.filter()`, `.sort()`, `.sort_elements()`,
`.current_index()`, `.first()`, and `.last()`.

It also uses the following methods, which correspond with the same
methods of the [Python dict].

* <a name="DADict.keys"></a>`keys()`
* <a name="DADict.values"></a>`values()`
* <a name="DADict.update"></a>`update()`
* <a name="DADict.pop"></a>`pop()`
* <a name="DADict.popitem"></a>`popitem()`
* <a name="DADict.setdefault"></a>`setdefault()`
* <a name="DADict.get"></a>`get()`
* <a name="DADict.copy"></a>`copy()`
* <a name="DADict.has_key"></a>`has_key()`
* <a name="DADict.items"></a>`items()`

For most purposes, your code can treat a `DADict` object just like a
[Python dictionary].

{% highlight yaml %}

<a name="DADict.all_true"></a><a name="DADict.all_false"></a><a name="DADict.any_true"></a><a name="DADict.any_false"></a>The
[`DADict`] object also uses some methods that are unique to it.  The
`all_true()` and `all_false()` methods are useful when working with
[checkbox groups].  If you use `datatype: checkboxes` to set a
variable called `choices`, then `choices` will be a [`DADict`] object.

If you call `choices.all_true()`, the result will be `True` if all of
the checkboxes were selected (i.e., all of the values of the
dictionary are `True`).  If you call `choices.any_false()`, the result
is the opposite of `choices.all_true()`.

If you call `choices.all_false()`, the result will be `True` if none
of the values were selected (i.e., all of the values of the dictionary
are `False`).  If you call `choices.any_true()`, the result is the
opposite of `choices.all_false()`.

You can also call these methods with parameters.  Calling
`choices.all_true('red', 'green')` will return `True` if the user
selected the choices for `'red'` and `'green'`.  Calling
`choices.all_true('red', 'green', exclusive=True)` will return `True`
if `'red'` and `'green'` were selected and these were the only choices
selected.

Here is an example that illustrates uses of `.all_true()`:

{% include side-by-side.html demo="all-true" %}

Here is an example that uses `.all_false()`:

{% include side-by-side.html demo="all-false" %}

<a name="DADict.true_values"></a>The method `.true_values()` will return a
[`DAList`] of keys that are `True`.

{% include side-by-side.html demo="true-values" %}

`.true_values()` accepts an optional keyword parameter
`insertion_order`. If `insertion_order` is set to `True`, then the
order of the keys returned by `.true_values()` will be the insertion
order of the underlying dictionary. Otherwise, the keys are sorted in
alphabetical order.

<a name="DADict.false_values"></a>Similarly, `.false_values()` will return a
[`DAList`] of keys that are `False`.

{% include side-by-side.html demo="false-values" %}

Like `.true_values()`, `.false_values()` accepts the optional keyword
parameter `insertion_order`.

For more information about using checkboxes, see the documentation for
[checkbox groups].

<a name="DADict.item"></a>Like the [`DAList`], the [`DADict`] supports
the method `item()`.  If `Fruit` is a `DADict`, `fruit.item('apple')`
is equivalent to `fruit['apple']`, except that if `fruit` does not
have an item `'apple'`, the result will be empty text.  This is
a helpful method in some contexts, such as fillable PDF forms.
Empty text will also result if you try to use attributes on the
result, so `fruit.item('apple').seeds` or
`fruit.item('apple').total_value()` will also result in empty text.

{% include side-by-side.html demo="item-dict" %}

For more information about using [`DADict`] objects, see the section
on [groups].

<a name="DADict.delitem"></a>You can delete one or more items from the
dictionary using the `delitem()` method.  For example,
`fruit.delitem('apple', 'orange')` removes the `'apple'` and
`'orange'` items from the list if they are present.  If an item is not
present, no error is raised.

<a name="DADict.invalidate_item"></a>Similar to the `invalidate_attr()`
method, the `invalidate_item()` method runs [`invalidate()`] on the
given items of the dictionary.

<a name="DADict.getitem_fresh"></a>Similar to the `getattr_fresh()`
method, the `getitem_fresh()` method runs [`reconsider()`] on the
given item in the list and then returns the recomputed item.  This
should only be used if the item value is computed, not posed to the
user as a question.

<a name="DADict.slice"></a>The `.slice()` method of the `DADict`
returns a [shallow copy] of the dictionary with a subset of the
original key/value pairs.  It can be called in one of two ways.  If
you give it a single positional parameter, where that parameter is a
function, the function will be applied to the value of the key/value
pair and if the result is true, the key/value pair will be included,
and if it is false, the key/value pair will be excluded.  For example,
if you have a [`DADict`] called `parties` where the values are
[`Individual`] objects, you can take a "slice" of the dictionary that
consists only of individuals who are 18 or older:

{% highlight python %}
adults = parties.slice(lambda y: y.age_in_years() >= 18)
{% endhighlight %}

If the values of a `DADict` are plain text phone numbers, this will
return a version of the `DADict` where the phone numbers are valid:

{% highlight python %}
good_numbers = phone_numbers.slice(phone_number_is_valid)
{% endhighlight %}

This uses the [`phone_number_is_valid()`] function.

The second way to call the `.slice()` method is to give it one or more
keys as positional parameters.  For example, if you have a `DADict`
called `income` where the keys are types of income and the values
represent the amount of income in that category, you can use
`.slice()` to get a dictionary that only contains particular keys of
the original dictionary:

{% highlight python %}
earnings = sum(income.slice('employment', 'self-employment').values())
{% endhighlight %}

## <a name="DAOrderedDict"></a>DAOrderedDict

The `DAOrderedDict` is just like the `DADict`, except it is based on a
[Python OrderedDict], rather than a [Python dict].  This means that
the data structure remembers the order in which keys are added, and
returns items in that order during iteration.

## <a name="DASet"></a>DASet

A `DASet` is like a [`DADict`] and a [`DAList`], except it acts like a
[Python] "[set]."

{% highlight yaml %}
objects:
  - issues: DASet
---
code: |
  if user_needs_to_apply:
    issues.add('application')
{% endhighlight %}

`DASet`s use the same methods that [`DAList`]s use, except for
`.appendObject()`, `.append()`, `.extend()`, `.first()`, and
`.last()`.  It also uses the following methods, which correspond with
the methods of the [Python set].

* <a name="DASet.add"></a>`add()`
* <a name="DASet.copy"></a>`copy()`
* <a name="DASet.discard"></a>`discard()`
* <a name="DASet.difference"></a>`difference()`
* <a name="DASet.intersection"></a>`intersection()`
* <a name="DASet.isdisjoint"></a>`isdisjoint()`
* <a name="DASet.issubset">`issubset()`
* <a name="DASet.issuperset"></a>`issuperset()`
* <a name="DASet.pop"></a>`pop()`
* <a name="DASet.remove"></a>`remove()`
* <a name="DASet.union"></a>`union()`

For more information about using [`DASet`] objects, see the section
on [groups].

<a name="DASet.hook_on_gather"></a>
<a name="DASet.hook_after_gather"></a>
<a name="DASet.hook_on_item_complete"></a>
<a name="DASet.hook_on_remove"></a>The `.hook*` methods that [`DAList`]
and [`DADict`] use are not available with [`DASet`].

## <a name="DAFile"></a>DAFile

A `DAFile` object is used to refer to a file, which might be an
uploaded file, an assembled document, or a file generated by code.  It
has the following attributes:

* `filename`: the filename (e.g., `complaint.pdf`). This attribute
  should be treated as read-only; you need to use `.set_attributes()`
  to actually change the name of a file on the server.
* `mimetype`: the MIME type of the file.
* `extension`: the file extension (e.g., `pdf` or `rtf`).
* `number`: the internal integer number used by **docassemble** to
  keep track of documents stored on a site.  (You will likely never
  need to use this.)
* `ok`: this is `True` if the `number` has been defined, and is
  otherwise `False`.  (You will likely never need to use this,
  either.)
* `alt_text` (optional): you can set this to a textual description of
  the file.  This can be useful if the file is an image that will be
  displayed in the browser.  The `alt_text` will then be used as the
  [alt text] for the image, which helps users of screen readers.  You
  can also use the [`set_alt_text()`] and [`get_alt_text()`] methods
  to set and get this attribute.

You might work with `DAFile` objects in the following contexts:

* Your interview contains a [document upload field].  The variable
  representing the upload will be set to a [`DAFileList`] object after
  the upload has been done.  If the
  variable name is `pretty_picture`, then `pretty_picture[0]` will be
  a `DAFile` object.
* Your interview assembles a document and the document is assigned to
  a [`variable name`].  If the variable name is
  `motion_to_reconsider`, then `motion_to_reconsider` will be a
  [`DAFileCollection`] object, the attributes of which represent the
  various formats of the document.  For example,
  `motion_to_reconsider.pdf` (the `.pdf` here is an attribute, not a
  file extension) will be a `DAFile` object representing the PDF
  version of the document.
* Your interview contains code that needs to create a file.  You can
  use an [`objects`] block to create a blank [`DAFile`] object.  Then
  you would call [`.initialize()`](#DAFile.initialize) to give the
  file a name and a presence on the file system.

You can call [`.path()`](#DAFile.path) on a `DAFile` object to get the
actual file path.  Using the file path, can manipulate the underlying
file directly in whatever way you want.  However, the `DAFile` object
has a number of built-in methods for doing common things with files,
so it is a good idea to use the methods whenever possible.

While the `DAFile` object is saved in your [interview session
dictionary] like any other variable, the content of the file may be
stored on [Amazon S3], [Azure blob storage], or the file system,
depending on the server's configuration.  The path you obtain from
[`.path()`](#DAFile.path) might be different from one screen of your
interview to another.  You should not save the path to a variable and
expect to be able to use that variable across screens of the
interview.  Rather, you should always access the file through the
`DAFile` object, using its built-in methods (such as
[`.path()`](#DAFile.path)).  These methods contain code that
automatically accounts for the fact that the file might be stored in
the cloud.  For example, if you use [Amazon S3], then when you call
[`.path()`](#DAFile.path)), this will cause the file to be retrieved
from [Amazon S3] and placed into a temporary directory.

The methods of `DAFile` are the following:

<a name="DAFile.initialize"></a>The `.initialize()` method transforms
a fresh, uninitialized `DAFile` object (e.g., a `DAFile` object
created by the [`objects`] block) into an object that can actually be
used as a file.  The method takes the optional keyword parameters
`filename` or `extension`.  The `.initialize()` method can be used as
follows (where `myfile` is a `DAFile` object):

* `myfile.initialize(filename='image.jpg')` - `filename` will be
  `image.jpg`, `extension` will be `jpg`, `mimetype` will be
  `image/jpeg`.
* `myfile.initialize(extension='jpg')` - `filename` will be
  `file.jpg`, `extension` will be `jpg`, `mimetype` will be
  `image/jpeg`.
* `myfile.initialize()` - `filename` will be `file.txt`, `extension`
  will be `txt`, `mimetype` will be `text/plain`.

When it completes, the `.initialize()` method sets the `initialized`
to `True`.

If the object has already been initialized, the `.initialize()` method
can safely be called on it, but this will only have the effect of
calling `.retrieve()` on it, and the `filename` and `extension`
parameters will not overwrite existing values. If you actually want to
redo the initialization process on a `DAObject` that has already been
initialized, you can set the optional keyword argument `reinitialize`
to `True`. This will delete any existing file from the file system and
reset the values of `filename`, `extension`, and `mimetype`.

The following example uses the [Python Imaging Library] to create a
JPEG image.

{% include side-by-side.html demo="dafile" %}

Note that because the `.initialize()` method defines the
`.initialized` attribute, you can attach `sets` to a `code` block that
calls `initialize()`. This way, your `code` block that initializes a
file can be called implicitly. In this example, the attempt to display
`myfile` in the `subquestion` of the final `question` causes
**docassemble** to seek out the value of `myfile.initialized`.

However, if the reason **docassemble** runs the `code` block is to
obtain a definition of `.initialized`, **docassemble** will be
satisfied as soon as `.initialize()` returns. If you have code that
runs after the call to `.initialize()`, you need to make sure that the
code does not refer to any undefined variables.

<a name="DAFile.show"></a>The `.show()` method returns markup that
displays the file as an image.  This method takes an optional keyword
argument, `width`, which can be set to, e.g., `'1in'`, `'44mm'`, or
`'20pt'`.  See [inserting images] for more information about this
markup.

In the context of a [Mako] template, writing `${ myfile }` is
equivalent to writing `${ myfile.show() }` (where `myfile` is a
`DAFile` object).

The method also takes an optional keyword argument `alt_text`, which
can be used to set the [alt text] of images that appear in the web
browser.  If an `alt_text` keyword argument is not supplied, the
`alt_text` attribute of the `DAFile` object itself will be used as the
[alt text].  If that attribute does not exist, no [alt text] will be
used.  (See the [`set_alt_text()`] and [`get_alt_text()`] methods for
more information about this attribute.)

<a name="DAFile.path"></a>The `.path()` method returns a complete file
path that you can use to read the file or write to the file.

<a name="DAFile.num_pages"></a>The `.num_pages()` method returns the
number of pages in a PDF file.  If the file is not a PDF file, it
returns 1.

<a name="DAFile.url_for"></a>The `.url_for()` method returns a URL at
which the file can be accessed.  The URL should only be used in the
context of the user's session and the user's web browser.

{% include side-by-side.html demo="dafile-url-for" %}

However, if you have set the `private` attribute to `False` by calling
`.set_attributes(private=False)` on the object, than the URL obtained
from `.url_for()` will be accessible to anyone, regardless of whether
they are logged in.  For more information, see
[`.set_attributes()`](#DAFile.set_attributes).

The following keyword parameters can be used.

`temporary` - the `.url_for()` method can also be used to generate a
temporary URL where anyone who knows the URL can access the file,
regardless of whether they are logged in, regardless of whether the
`private` attribute is `True` or `False`.  To obtain such a URL,
include `temporary=True` as a keyword parameter.  By default, the URL
will expire after 30 seconds.  To extend this time, include the
optional keyword parameter `seconds`.  This example creates a URL that
expires in 60 seconds.

{% include side-by-side.html demo="dafile-url-for-temporary" %}

`external` - by default, the URLs returned by `.url_for()` will be
root-relative URLs.  If you want URLs that include the protocol and
hostname, include `external=True` when you call `.url_for()`.  Using
`temporary=True` implies `external=True`.

`attachment` - by default, the URLs return files suitable for
inclusion in web pages.  If you want the user to download the file
when accessing the link, you can set `attachment` to `True`.  Then the
`Content-Disposition` header in the response will be set so that the
file can be downloaded.

`page` and `size` - if the `DAFile` is a PDF, you can obtain a URL for
a PNG image of a specific page of the file by passing the `page`
parameter.  The `page` indicates the page number (starting with 1).
The `size` can be either `'screen'` for a 72 DPI image or `'page'` for
a 300 DPI image.  The `size` is optional and it defaults to `'page'`.
The [Configuration] directives [`png screen resolution`] and [`png
resolution`] can be used to change these default DPI values.  If the
PNG image has not yet been created by the time the user visits the
URL, **docassemble** will generate the PNG image.  Converting PDF to
PNG can be time-consuming, so the server may not respond immediately.
If the URL is accessed while there is a pending background task that
is converting the PDF page images to PNG, the server will wait for
that background task to create the image, which may take even longer.

<a name="DAFile.page_path"></a>The `.page_path()` method returns a
file system path to a PNG page image for a given page of a PDF file.
If your `DAFile` is `myfile`, calling `myfile.page_path(1, 'page')`
will return the path of a PNG image with a resolution of 300 DPI for
the first page of the document.  Calling `myfile.page_path(5,
'screen')` will return the path of a PNG image with a resolution of 72
DPI for the fifth page of the document.  If the PNG file does not
already exist on the server, `.page_path()` will create it, or if
there is an ongoing background task for creating PNG page images,
`.page_path()` will wait for that background task to create the PNG
image.  Thus, `.page_path()` could take several seconds to return a
value, depending on the circumstances.  `.page_path()` accepts an
optional keyword parameter, `wait`.  If the PNG image has not been
generated yet, and `.page_path()` is called with `wait=False`, then
`.page_path()` will not trigger the PNG creation process or wait for
any ongoing process to complete, and instead will immediately return
`None`.  A background task is launched to create page images from a
PDF file when a user uploads a file through a `datatype: file` or
`datatype: files` field, when a file is uploaded to `/api/session`,
and when the `.pngs_ready()` method is called on a `DAFile`.  If the
PDF to PNG creation process fails, `.page_path()` will return `None`.

<a name="DAFile.pngs_ready"></a>The `.pngs_ready()` method triggers a
background process for creating PNG images from a PDF file, if the
process has not already started, and returns `True` or `False`
depending on whether the PNG creation process has completed. The
resulting PNG files can be accessed using `.page_path()` and
`.url_for()`.  The PNG images are also used in various other contexts,
such as when inserting a PDF file into a DOCX file or inserting a
`DAFile` into the screen of the web application.

<a name="DAFile.retrieve"></a>The `.retrieve()` command ensures that a
stored file is ready for use on the system.  Calling `.retrieve` is
necessary because if **docassemble** is configured to use [Amazon S3]
or [Azure blob storage], documents are stored in the cloud, and the
server accesses them by copying them from the cloud to the server and
then copying them back to the cloud.  If the file does not exist yet,
calling `.retrieve()` will generate an error.

<a name="DAFile.set_attributes"></a>The `.set_attributes()` command
allows you to set three characteristics of the uploaded document:

* `private`: the default value of this attribute is `True`, which
  means that other interviews and other interview sessions cannot
  access the contents of the file, even if they know the `.number`, or
  have the `DAFile` object itself, or have a URL to the file obtained
  from [`.url_for()`](#DAFile.url_for).  You will need to set the
  `private` attribute to `False` if you want other sessions or other
  users to be able to access the file.  For example, you might store
  a [`DAFile`] object in [storage] and retrieve it within other
  interviews at a later time.  The contents of the file will not be
  accessible unless you set `private` to `False`.
* `persistent`: the default value of this attribute is `False`, which
  means that the file will be deleted when the interview session is
  deleted.  Interview sessions are deleted when the user presses an
  [exit button] or an [exit command] is run.  Interview sessions are
  also deleted when the session has been [inactive for a period].  You
  can prevent the deletion of a file by setting the `persistent`
  attribute to `True`.
* `filename`: the name of the file, e.g., `complaint.pdf`. Note that
  while you can use [`.set_attributes()`] to change the filename, you
  cannot use it to change the file type. The file type (its MIME type
  and extension) are intrinsic to the file as it is stored on the file
  system. If you want to change the type of a file you would need to
  use [`.convert_to()`] or initialize a new file.

You can set these attributes with code like this:

{% highlight yaml %}
question: |
  Sign your name
signature: user_signature
---
mandatory: True
code: |
  user_signature.set_attributes(persistent=True)
{% endhighlight %}

To read the values of the attributes for a variable like
`user_signature`, refer to `user_signature.private` and
`user_signature.persistent`, which are set by
[`.retrieve()`](#DAFile.retrieve).  Setting these attributes directly
has no effect; you need to use [`.set_attributes()`] to set them.

When allowing users to upload files using [`datatype: file`], you can
use field modifiers to set initial values for `private` and
`persistent`.

<a name="DAFile.user_access"></a>You can use the `.user_access()`
method to grant or deny access to particular users.  Suppose you have
a `DAFile` called `my_file`.  You can call:

{% highlight python %}
my_file.user_access('jsmith@example.com', 'sjones@example.com')
{% endhighlight %}

This will grant access to the users on the system with those
usernames.  You can also reference user IDs:

{% highlight python %}
my_file.user_access(21, 43, 54)
{% endhighlight %}

To deny access, you can set the optional keyword parameter `disallow`:

{% highlight python %}
my_file.user_access(disallow='jsmith@example.com')
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight python %}
my_file.user_access(disallow=['jsmith@example.com', 'sjones@example.com'])
{% endhighlight %}

To disallow access completely, set `disallow` to `'all'`:

{% highlight python %}
my_file.user_access(disallow='all')
{% endhighlight %}

To find out which users have been assigned privileges, run the
`.user_access()` method on a `DAFile` (not a [`DAFileList`] or
[`DAFileCollection`]) without any arguments.  The result will be a
dictionary with the following keys:

* `user_ids`: a list of user IDs;
* `emails`: a list of e-mail addresses of users with access; and
* `temp_user_ids`: a list of temporary user IDs for non-logged in
  users who have access (such users cannot be assigned).

Note that the `user_access()` method only reports users who have
been given explicit access; users who have joined the interview also
have access; to take away their access, you would need to delete their
session.

<a name="DAFile.privilege_access"></a>You can use the
`.privilege_access()` method to manage access to a file based on the
privileges of users.  Suppose you have a `DAFile` called `my_file`.
You can call:

{% highlight python %}
my_file.privilege_access('developer', 'advocate')
{% endhighlight %}

You can also take privileges away:

{% highlight python %}
my_file.privilege_access(disallow=['developer', 'advocate'])
{% endhighlight %}

To take all privileges away, use the special code `'all'`:

{% highlight python %}
my_file.privilege_access(disallow='all')
{% endhighlight %}

To see what privileges have access to a file, call
`.privilege_access()` on a `DAFile` without any parameters:

{% highlight python %}
privileges_list = my_file.privilege_access()
{% endhighlight %}

This will return a list of privileges (e.g., `['developer', 'user']`).

<a name="DAFile.convert_to"></a>The `.convert_to()` method accepts a
single positional parameter, which is expected to be `'pdf'`, `'docx'`,
`'doc'`, `'odt'`, `'rtf'`, `'png'`, `'jpg'`, `'tif'`, or `'md'`.  The
file will be converted in place to that format.  Word processing files
cannot be converted to image files, and vice-versa.  If the conversion
fails, an exception will be raised.

The `.convert_to()` method accepts an optional keyword parameter,
`output_to`, which can be set to a [`DAFile`]. If `output_to` is
specified, then the input file is not converted in-place, and instead
the `output_to` file will be be redefined to contain the converted
file.

<a name="DAFile.size_in_bytes"></a>The `.size_in_bytes()` method
returns the number of bytes in the file.

<a name="DAFile.slurp"></a>The `.slurp()` method reads the contents of
the file and returns them as a text value.

{% highlight python %}
contents = the_file.slurp()
{% endhighlight %}

By default, the `.slurp()` method attempts to automatically decode
text files using the `utf-8` encoding.  To turn off this automatic
decoding feature, call it with `.slurp(auto_decode=False)`.

<a name="DAFile.readlines"></a>The `.readlines()` method reads the
contents of the file, line-by-line, and returns the lines as a list.

{% highlight python %}
for line in the_file.readlines():
  if line.startswith('header'):
    header_line = line
{% endhighlight %}

<a name="DAFile.set_mimetype"></a>The `.set_mimetype()` method sets
the `.mimetype` and `.extension` attributes based on the given
[MIME type].

{% highlight python %}
the_file.set_mimetype('image/jpeg')
{% endhighlight %}

<a name="DAFile.write"></a>The `.write()` method takes a variable as
an argument and writes the contents of the variable to the file.

{% highlight python %}
contents = the_file.slurp()
contents = re.sub(r'swords', r'ploughshares', contents)
the_file.write(contents)
{% endhighlight %}

By default, the `.write()` method treats the contents as text and
applies the `utf-8` encoding.  However, if you want to write raw
bytes to the file, include the keyword parameter `binary=True`.

<a name="DAFile.copy_into"></a>The `.copy_into()` method overwrites
any existing contents of the file with the contents of the file given
as an argument.

{% highlight python %}
the_file.copy_into(other_file)
{% endhighlight %}

The `other_file` can be a path to a file on the system.  If
`other_file` is a [`DAFile`], [`DAFileList`], [`DAFileCollection`], or
[`DAStaticFile`], the file at `other_file.path()` will be used.

<a name="DAFile.from_url"></a>The `.from_url()` method overwrites
any existing contents of the file with the contents of the given URL.

{% highlight python %}
the_file.from_url("https://example.com/file.pdf")
{% endhighlight %}

In order to initialize a `DAFile` with contents from a remote source so that
it can be used in an interview, first declare the object:

{% highlight yaml %}
objects:
  - pdf_file: DAFile
{% endhighlight %}

Then use [`code`] to initialize the object and set the contents:

{% highlight yaml %}
sets: pdf_file.initialized
code: |
  pdf_file.initialize(extension="pdf")
  pdf_file.from_url("https://example.com/the_file.pdf")
{% endhighlight %}

<a name="DAFile.make_ocr_pdf"></a>The `.make_ocr_pdf()` method overwrites
any existing contents of the file with an [OCR]ed [PDF] of a given file.

{% include demo-side-by-side.html demo="make-ocr-pdf" %}

The `make_ocr_pdf()` method accepts the following optional keyword
arguments:

* `filename`: the filename of the new PDF file that is created.
* `preserve_color`: whether to preserve the color of the document.  By
  default, this is `False` because the [OCR] is more accurate if the
  document is converted to grayscale.
* `language`: the language to use for the [OCR] (e.g., `'en'`,
  `'fr'`).  If not specified, the language returned by
  `get_language()` is used.  The language must be a lowercase
  [ISO-639-1]/[ISO-639-3] code or a language code that [Tesseract]
  uses.
* `psm` indicates the [Tesseract] page segmentation mode.  The default
is 6 ("assume a uniform block of text").  The choices are:
    * 0: Orientation and script detection (OSD) only.
    * 1: Automatic page segmentation with OSD.
    * 2: Automatic page segmentation, but no OSD, or OCR.
    * 3: Fully automatic page segmentation, but no OSD.
    * 4: Assume a single column of text of variable sizes.
    * 5: Assume a single uniform block of vertically aligned text.
    * 6: Assume a single uniform block of text. (Default)
    * 7: Treat the image as a single text line.
    * 8: Treat the image as a single word.
    * 9: Treat the image as a single word in a circle.
    * 10: Treat the image as a single character.

If you do not want to edit the file in place, you can create a new
`DAFile` with an `objects` block and pass files that you want to OCR
as positional parameters to `make_ocr_pdf()`.

<a name="DAFile.make_ocr_pdf_in_background"></a>Since the [OCR]
process can take a long time, you might want to use the
`make_ocr_pdf_in_background()` method instead.

{% include demo-side-by-side.html demo="make-ocr-pdf-in-background" %}

The `.make_ocr_pdf_in_background()` method operates just like
`.make_ocr_pdf()`, but does the work in a [background action].  It
returns the same type of object as [`background_action()`].  When the
[background action] is complete, the `DAFile` instance will be
overwritten with the OCRed version of the PDF file.

If you do not want to edit a PDF file in place, you can create a new
`DAFile` with an `objects` block and pass files that you want to OCR
as positional parameters to `make_ocr_pdf_in_background()`.

{% include demo-side-by-side.html demo="make-ocr-pdf-in-background-2" %}

<a name="DAFile.extract_pages"></a>The `.extract_pages()` method
extracts a page range from a PDF file and returns a new [`DAFile`]
containing the extracted pages.

{% include demo-side-by-side.html demo="pdfextract" %}

The `.extract_pages()` method accepts the optional keyword parameters
`first` and `last`, indicating the sequential range of page numbers
you wish to extract. If `first` is not provided, it defaults to
`1`. If `last` is not provided, it defaults to the last page of the
document.

The optional keyword parameter `output_to` can be used to specify a
[`DAFile`] to which the output of `.extract_pages()` should be
written. If `output_to` is omitted, a [`DAFile`] with a random
instance name will be returned.

<a name="DAFile.bates_number"></a>The `.bates_number()` method overwrites
any existing contents of the file with a [Bates numbered] PDF of the
file.

{% include demo-side-by-side.html demo="bates-number" %}

The `bates_number()` method accepts the following optional keyword
arguments:

* `filename`: the filename of the new PDF file that is created.
* `prefix`: the prefix for the Bates numbers.
* `digits`: the number of digits of your Bates numbers.
* `start`: the number at which Bates numbering should start (default
  is 1).
* `area`: the area of the page where the Bates numbers should be
  positioned.  The choices are `'TOP_LEFT'`, `'TOP_RIGHT'`,
  `'BOTTOM_RIGHT'`, and `'BOTTOM_LEFT'`.  The default is
  `'BOTTOM_LEFT'`.

If you do not want to edit the file in place, you can create a new
`DAFile` with an `objects` block and pass files that you want to OCR
as positional parameters to `bates_number()`.

<a name="DAFile.commit"></a>The `.commit()` method ensures that
changes to the file are stored permanently.  Under normal
circumstances, **docassemble** will automatically commit changes when
the interview is finished processing (i.e. right before a new screen
appears), but `.commit()` can be called to ensure that changes are
written, just in case there is an error.

{% highlight python %}
the_file.commit()
{% endhighlight %}

<a name="DAFile.fix_up"></a>The `.fix_up()` method edits files in
place in order to correct any errors that are correctable.  Currently,
the only function of `.fix_up()` is to run PDF files through [qpdf].
Additional operations may be supported in the future.

The `.fix_up()` method will raise an exception if the file is invalid
even after correction.  A helpful way to use `.fix_up()` is in
`validation code`:

{% highlight yaml %}
question: |
  Upload a PDF file.
fields:
  - File: myfile
    datatype: file
validation code: |
  try:
    for item in myfile:
      assert item.mimetype == 'application/pdf'
    myfile.fix_up()
  except:
    raise validation_error("Sorry, that is not a valid PDF file")
{% endhighlight %}

If a user uploads a PDF file that is corrupted but correctable with
[qpdf], then the contents of the file will be replaced with the output
of [qpdf].  If [qpdf] fails or the file is still not readable after
correction, an exception will be raised.

In this example, `myfile` is a [`DAFileList`] rather than a
[`DAFile`], but the `.fix_up()` method of [`DAFileList`] simply
applies `.fix_up()` to each [`DAFile`] in `myfile`.

<a name="DAFile.set_alt_text"></a><a
name="DAFile.get_alt_text"></a>The `.set_alt_text()` and
`.get_alt_text()` methods can be used to set and retrieve the [alt
text] of the object, which is stored in the `.alt_text` attribute.
The `.alt_text` attribute can be accessed directly, but the methods
are useful because `.get_alt_text()` returns `None` if `.alt_text` is
not defined, and converts the attribute value to unicode if it is not
unicode.  The methods are also useful because they work on file
objects of all types, such as [`DAStaticFile`], [`DAFileList`], and
[`DAFileCollection`] objects.

{% highlight python %}
my_file.set_alt_text("A photograph of the Shanghai skyline")
the_alt_text = my_file.get_alt_text()
{% endhighlight %}

<a name="DAFile.uses_acroform"></a>The `.uses_acroform()` method
returns `True` if the file is a PDF file that contains form fields in
the `AcroForm` format.  Otherwise, it returns `False`.

<a name="DAFile.is_encrypted"></a>The `.is_encrypted()` method returns
`True` if the file is a PDF file and the PDF file is encrypted.
Otherwise it returns `False`.

<a name="DAFile.get_pdf_fields"></a>The `.get_pdf_fields()` method
only works on PDF files.  It returns a list of fields that exist in
the PDF file.

The items in the list are tuples with five elements.  The five
elements are:

1. The name of the field.
2. The default value of the field.  If no default value is provided in
   the PDF file, this is the empty string for text fields and `'No'`
   for checkbox fields.
3. The page number on which the field appears.
4. A list of four coordinates indicating the bounding box of the field
   on the page.
5. A code indicating the type of the field.  This can be `'/Tx'`,
   `'/Btn'`, or `None`.
6. The export value of the field, if known.  This is only applicable
   for `'/Btn'` fields.

<a name="DAFile.get_docx_variables"></a>The `.get_docx_variables()`
method only works on DOCX files.  It returns a list of variables that
are used in Jinja2 templating in the DOCX file.

## <a name="DAFileCollection"></a>DAFileCollection

`DAFileCollection` objects are created internally by **docassemble**
in order to refer to a document assembled by an
[`attachment`]/[`attachments`] block.  When such a block features a
`variable name`, then a variable by that name will be defined as a
`DAFileCollection` object.  The object is called a "collection"
because an [`attachment`] can have multiple formats: PDF, RTF, etc.

A `DAFileCollection` object has attributes for each file type
generated (e.g., `pdf` or `rtf`), where the attributes are objects of
type [`DAFile`].

For example, if the variable `my_file` is a `DAFileCollection`,
`my_file.pdf` will be a [`DAFile`] containing the PDF version, and
`my_file.rtf` will be a [`DAFile`] containing the RTF version.

In addition, each `DAFileCollection` object also has an attribute
`.info` containing information about the attachment, such as the name,
the filename (before an extension is added), and a description.  The
`.info` attribute is a dictionary containing the following keys:

* `name` is the printable name of the document
* `filename` is the base name used to generate the filename.  If
  `filename` is `custody_complaint`, the PDF file will be `custody_complaint.pdf`.
* `description` is the description of the attachment.

The `DAFileCollection` also has some methods so that you can use it
much as you would use a `DAFile`.

<a name="DAFileCollection.url_for"></a>The `.url_for()` method returns
a URL to the first document type in the collection.  By default, this
is the PDF version, but this can be changed with the [valid formats]
modifier.

<a name="DAFileCollection.path"></a>The `.path()` method returns a
complete file path that you can use to access the first document type
in the collection.

<a name="DAFileCollection.num_pages"></a>The `.num_pages()` method
returns the total number of pages in the PDF file.  If there is no PDF
file, it returns 1.

<a name="DAFileCollection.show"></a>The `.show()` method inserts
markup that displays each file in the collection as an image, or as a
link if the file cannot be displayed as an image.  This
method takes an optional keyword argument, `width`.

The method also takes an optional keyword argument `alt_text`, which
can be used to set the [alt text] of images that appear in the web
browser.  If an `alt_text` keyword argument is not supplied,
[`get_alt_text()`] is called on the underlying [`DAFile`] object to
obtain the [alt text].  If no `alt_text` is defined for the file, no
[alt text] is used.

<a name="DAFileCollection.fix_up"></a>The `.fix_up()` method edits files in
place in order to correct any errors that are correctable.  Currently,
the only function of `.fix_up()` is to run PDF files through [qpdf] if
they cannot be opened by [PyPDF2].  Additional operations may be
supported in the future.

<a name="DAFileCollection.set_alt_text"></a><a
name="DAFileCollection.get_alt_text"></a>The `DAFileCollection` object
supports the `.set_alt_text()` and `.get_alt_text()` methods.  These
work much like the [`set_alt_text()`] and [`get_alt_text()`] methods
of [`DAFile`].  Unlike a `DAFile`, however, a `DAFileCollection` does
not have a `.alt_text` attribute.  If you run `set_alt_text()` on a
[`DAFileCollection`], it is like calling `set_alt_text()` on each of
the files in the collection.  If you run `get_alt_text()` on a
`DAFileCollection`, it is like calling [`get_alt_text()`] on the first
document type in the collection.

<a name="DAFileCollection.set_attributes"></a>The `.set_attributes()`
method calls [`.set_attributes()`] on each of the [`DAFile`]s in the
collection, applying the same attributes to each file.  For an
explanation of how this method works, see [its
documentation](#DAFile.set_attributes).

<a name="DAFileCollection.user_access"></a>The `.user_access()` method
calls [`.user_access()`] on each of the [`DAFile`]s in the list.  If
called with no parameters, it returns `None`; if you want to inspect
information about a file, call the method on a specific item in the
list.

<a name="DAFileCollection.privilege_access"></a>The
`.privilege_access()` method calls [`.privilege_access()`] on each of
the [`DAFile`]s in the list.  If called with no parameters, it returns
`None`; if you want to inspect information about a file, call the
method on a specific item in the list.

<a name="DAFileCollection.uses_acroform"></a>The `.uses_acroform()`
method returns `True` if the collection contains a PDF file and the
PDF file contains form fields in the `AcroForm` format.  Otherwise, it
returns `False`.

<a name="DAFileCollection.is_encrypted"></a>The `.is_encrypted()`
method returns `True` if there is a PDF version of the
`DAFileCollection` object and that PDF file is encrypted.  Otherwise
it returns `False`.

<a name="DAFileCollection.get_pdf_fields"></a>The `.get_pdf_fields()`
returns a list of fields that exist in the PDF version of the
`DAFileCollection` object.  See [`get_pdf_fields()`] for more
information.

<a name="DAFileCollection.get_docx_variables"></a>The
`.get_docx_variables()` returns a list of variables that exist in the
Jinja2 templating of the DOCX version of the `DAFileCollection`
object.  See [`get_docx_variables()`] for more information.

## <a name="DAFileList"></a>DAFileList

A `DAFileList` is a [`DAList`], the items of which are expected to be
[`DAFile`] objects.

When a question has a field with a `datatype` for a file upload
([`datatype: file`] and [`datatype: files`]), the variable will be
defined as a `DAFileList` object containing the file or files
uploaded.  These variables can be used in much the same way that
[`DAFile`] variables can be used.

By default, the `complete_attribute` of a `DAFileList` is
`initialized`, and the `object_type` is `DAFile`.

<a name="DAFileList.show"></a>The `.show()` method inserts markup that
displays each file as an image.  This method takes an optional keyword
argument, `width`.

When included in a [Mako] template, a `DAFileList` object will effectively
call `show()` on itself.

The method also takes an optional keyword argument `alt_text`, which
can be used to set the [alt text] of images that appear in the web
browser.  If an `alt_text` keyword argument is not supplied,
[`get_alt_text()`] is called on the underlying [`DAFile`] object to
obtain the [alt text].  If no `alt_text` is defined for the file, no
[alt text] is used.

<a name="DAFileList.url_for"></a>The `.url_for()` method returns a URL
at which the first file in the list can be accessed.  This is useful
when working with `DAFileList` objects returned from
[`datatype: file`], when you know that the list will only have one
element in it.

<a name="DAFileList.path"></a>The `.path()` method returns a complete
file path that you can use to access the first file in the collection.

<a name="DAFileList.size_in_bytes"></a>The `.size_in_bytes()` method
returns the number of bytes in the first file in the collection.

<a name="DAFileList.slurp"></a>The `.slurp()` method reads the
contents of the first file in the collection and returns them as a
text value.

<a name="DAFileList.num_pages"></a>The `.num_pages()` method returns
the total number of pages in all PDF files in the list.  If a file is
not a PDF file, it counts as 1 page.

<a name="DAFileList.set_attributes"></a>The `.set_attributes()` method
calls [`.set_attributes()`] on each of the [`DAFile`]s in the list,
applying the same attributes to each file.  For an explanation of how
this method works, see [its documentation](#DAFile.set_attributes).

You would call the method like this:

{% highlight yaml %}
question: |
  Upload a file
fields:
  - File: the_upload
    datatype: file
---
mandatory: True
code: |
  the_upload.set_attributes(private=False)
{% endhighlight %}

<a name="DAFileList.user_access"></a>The `.user_access()` method calls
[`.user_access()`] on each of the [`DAFile`]s in the list.  If called
with no parameters, it returns `None`; if you want to inspect
information about a file, call the method on a specific item in the
list.

<a name="DAFileList.privilege_access"></a>The `.privilege_access()`
method calls [`.privilege_access()`] on each of the [`DAFile`]s in the
list.  If called with no parameters, it returns `None`; if you want to
inspect information about a file, call the method on a specific item
in the list.

<a name="DAFileList.fix_up"></a>The `.fix_up()` method edits the files
in the list in-place in order to correct any errors that are
correctable.  Currently, the only function of `.fix_up()` is to run
PDF files through [qpdf] if they cannot be opened by [PyPDF2].
Additional operations may be supported in the future.

<a name="DAFileList.set_alt_text"></a><a
name="DAFileList.get_alt_text"></a>The `DAFileList` object supports
the `.set_alt_text()` and `.get_alt_text()` methods.  These work much
like the [`set_alt_text()`] and [`get_alt_text()`] methods of
[`DAFile`].  Unlike a `DAFile`, however, a `DAFileList` does not have
a `.alt_text` attribute.  If you run `set_alt_text()` on a
[`DAFileList`], it is like calling `set_alt_text()` on each of the
items in the list.  If you run `get_alt_text()` on a `DAFileList`, it
is like calling [`get_alt_text()`] on the first item in the list.

<a name="DAFileList.uses_acroform"></a>The `.uses_acroform()` method
returns `True` if the first file in the list is a PDF file that
contains form fields in the `AcroForm` format.  Otherwise, it returns
`False`.

<a name="DAFileList.is_encrypted"></a>The `.is_encrypted()` method
returns `True` if the first file in the list is a PDF file that file
is encrypted.  Otherwise it returns `False`.

<a name="DAFileList.get_pdf_fields"></a>The `.get_pdf_fields()` method
returns a list of fields that exist in the first file in the list.  If
you run `get_pdf_fields()` on a `DAFileList`, it is like calling
[`get_pdf_fields()`] on the first item in the list.  See
[`get_pdf_fields()`] for more information.

<a name="DAFileList.get_docx_variables"></a>The
`.get_docx_variables()` method returns a list of variables that exist
in the Jinja2 templating of the first file in the list.  If you run
`get_docx_variables()` on a `DAFileList`, it is like calling
[`get_docx_variables()`] on the first item in the list.  See
[`get_docx_variables()`] for more information.

## <a name="DAStaticFile"></a>DAStaticFile

A `DAStaticFile` represents a file in the "static folder" of a
package.  It has some of the same characteristics and methods of a
[`DAFile`].

It depends on one attribute, `filename`, which should be a reference
to a static file, such as:

* `coins.png` - a file in the static folder of the current package
* `docassemble.base:data/static/cow.jpg` - a file in the static folder
  of another package.
* `data/templates/application.pdf` - a file in the templates folder of
  the current package.  (Though template files are not in the static
  folder and are not normally used in the same way as static files, it
  can be useful to use the `DAStaticFile` object to refer to files in
  the templates folder.)

The `DAStaticFile` also uses the `alt_text` attribute.  If you are
using a `DAStaticFile` to insert an image into the browser, you can
set the `alt_text` attribute to the text that you want to use as the
[alt text] for the image.

The `DAStaticFile` object can be used like this:

{% include side-by-side.html demo="static-file" %}

It can also be initialized like this:

{% highlight yaml %}
objects:
  - the_icon: DAStaticFile.using(filename='coins.png')
{% endhighlight %}

It is a best practice to always include [alt text] for every image.
For an image that is purely decorative, set the [alt text] to empty
text:

{% highlight yaml %}
objects:
  - the_icon: DAStaticFile.using(filename='coins.png', alt_text='')
{% endhighlight %}

For an image that conveys substantive information, set the [alt text]
to something descriptive:

{% highlight yaml %}
objects:
  - court_photo: DAStaticFile.using(filename='county_court.jpg', alt_text='Photograph of the Fulton County Courthouse')
{% endhighlight %}

<a name="DAStaticFile.show"></a>The `.show()` method inserts markup that
displays the file as an image.  This method takes an optional keyword
argument, `width`.

The method also takes an optional keyword argument `alt_text`, which
can be used to set the [alt text] of images that appear in the web
browser.  If an `alt_text` keyword argument is not supplied, the
`alt_text` attribute of the `DAStaticFile` object itself will be used
as the [alt text].  If that attribute does not exist, no [alt text]
will be used.

When included in a [Mako] template, a `DAStaticFile` object will effectively
call `show()` on itself.

<a name="DAStaticFile.size_in_bytes"></a>The `.size_in_bytes()` method
returns the number of bytes in the file.

<a name="DAStaticFile.slurp"></a>The `.slurp()` method reads the contents of
the file and returns them as a text value.

{% highlight python %}
contents = the_file.slurp()
{% endhighlight %}

By default, the `.slurp()` method attempts to automatically decode
text files using the `utf8` encoding.  To turn off this automatic
decoding feature, call it with `.slurp(auto_decode=False)`.

<a name="DAStaticFile.url_for"></a>The `.url_for()` method returns a
URL at which the file can be accessed.

<a name="DAStaticFile.path"></a>The `.path()` method returns a complete
file path that you can use to access the file on the server.

<a name="DAStaticFile.set_alt_text"></a><a
name="DAStaticFile.get_alt_text"></a>The `DAStaticFile` object
supports the `.set_alt_text()` and `.get_alt_text()` methods.  These
work much like the [`set_alt_text()`] and [`get_alt_text()`] methods
of [`DAFile`].  Like [`DAFile`] objects, [`DAStaticFile`] objects use
the `alt_text` attribute to store the [alt text] associated with the
file.

Here is an example that shows how [`DAStaticFile`],
[`DAFileCollection`], [`DAFileList`], and [`DAFile`] objects can be
used interchangeably.

{% include side-by-side.html demo="file-types" %}

<a name="DAStaticFile.uses_acroform"></a>The `.uses_acroform()` method
returns `True` if the file is a PDF file that contains form fields in
the `AcroForm` format.  Otherwise, it returns `False`.

<a name="DAStaticFile.is_encrypted"></a>The `.is_encrypted()` method
returns `True` if the file is a PDF file and it is encrypted.
Otherwise it returns `False`.

<a name="DAStaticFile.get_pdf_fields"></a>The `.get_pdf_fields()` method
only works on PDF files.  It returns a list of fields that exist in
the PDF file.  See [`get_pdf_fields()`] for more information.

<a name="DAStaticFile.get_docx_variables"></a>The
`.get_docx_variables()` method only works on DOCX files.  It returns a
list of variables that exist in the Jinja2 templating of the file.
See [`get_docx_variables()`] for more information.

## <a name="DAContext"></a>DAContext

The `DAContext` class is for context-dependent text.  When an instance
of the `DAContext` class is reduced to text, different text will be
used depending on whether the text will appear on the screen or in a
document.

The `DAContext` class is a subclass of [`DADict`].  Possible keys of the
dictionary include:

* `'question'`
* `'document'`
* `'pdf'`
* `'docx'`
* `'pandoc'`

If `favorite_fruit` is a `DAContext`, reducing it to text will return
`favorite_fruit['question']` in the context of the web application,
and `favorite_fruit['document']` in the context of document assembly.

Instead of using `'document'`, you can indicate particular values for
particular types of document assembly.  If you define
`favorite_fruit['pdf']`, its value will be used in a [`pdf template
file`] assembly instead of `favorite_fruit['document']`.

When a `DAContext` object is initialized, the positional and keyword
parameters are used to populate items in the dictionary.  If you
provide two positional parameters, the first parameter will become the
`question` and the second will become the `document`.  If you pass one
positional parameter, the parameter will become the `question`.
Keyword parameters populate items in the dictionary directly
(overriding positional parameters).

{% include demo-side-by-side.html demo="context-manual" %}

If you use a [`data`] block with [`use objects`] enabled, `DAContext`
objects will be created instead of [`DADict`] objects when the [YAML]
includes a dictionary where the keys are a non-empty subset of
`question`, `document`, `pdf`, `docx`, and `pandoc`.

{% include demo-side-by-side.html demo="context" %}

## <a name="DAEmail"></a>DAEmail

The [e-mail receiving] feature converts actual e-mails into objects of
type `DAEmail`.  These objects have the following attributes:

* `short`: the code that was assigned by [`interview_email()`]
  (e.g. `ugjrye`) in order to create the e-mail address to which this
  e-mail was sent (e.g. `ugjrye@help.example.com`).
* `key`: the `key` that was passed to [`interview_email()`], or `None` if no
  `key` was passed.
* `index`: the `index` that was passed to [`interview_email()`], or
  `None` if no index was passed.
* `address_owner`: the e-mail address of the user whose identity and
  privileges were being used when [`interview_email()`] was called.
  If the user was not logged in when [`interview_email()`] was called,
  this will be `None`.
* `to_address`: a [`DAEmailRecipientList`] object representing the
  recipients of the e-mail.
* `cc_address`: a [`DAEmailRecipientList`] object representing the
  "carbon copy" recipients of the e-mail.
* `from_address`: a [`DAEmailRecipient`] object representing the
  sender of the e-mail.
* `reply_to`: a [`DAEmailRecipient`] object representing the
  the [Reply-to] header of the e-mail.
* `return_path`: a [`DAEmailRecipient`] object representing the
  the [Return-path] header of the e-mail.
* `subject`: the subject line of the e-mail.
* `datetime_message`: a [`datetime`] object representing the stated date
  and time of the e-mail message.
* `datetime_received`: a [`datetime`] object representing the actual
  date and time of the message.
* `body_text`: a [`DAFile`] object referring to a file containing the
  plain text version of the e-mail.  If the e-mail did not contain a
  plain text version, `body_text` will be `None`.
* `body_html`: a [`DAFile`] object referring to a file containing the
  [HTML] version of the e-mail.  If the e-mail did not contain a
  [HTML] version, `body_html` will be `None`.
* `attachment`: an object of type [`DAFileList`] containing any
  files that were attached to the e-mail.  Each attachment is a
  [`DAFile`] object.
* `headers`: a [`DAFile`] object referring to a file containing a
  [JSON] representation of the headers of the e-mail.  The format of
  the [JSON] file is a [list], where each item in the [list] is a
  [list] with two items, the first of which is the name of the
  header (e.g., `To`, `From`), and the second item is the value.

## <a name="DAEmailRecipient"></a>DAEmailRecipient

A `DAEmailRecipient` object is used within [`DAEmail`] objects to
represent a single e-mail address and the name associated with the
e-mail address.

It has two attributes:

* `address`: the e-mail address (e.g., `fred1985@yahoo.com`).
* `name`: the name of the owner of the address (e.g., `Fred Smith`).

### <a name="DAEmailRecipient.email_address"></a>`.email_address()`

If `recipient` is a `DAEmailRecipient`, then calling
`recipient.email_address()` will return the person's name followed by
the person's e-mail address, in the standard e-mail format.  E.g.,
`'Fred Smith <fred1985@yahoo.com>'`.  If the name is not defined,
it will simply return the e-mail address (`fred1985@yahoo.com`).

You can suppress the inclusion of the person's name by setting the
optional keyword parameter `include_name` to `False`.

This method is intended to allow you to use `DAEmailRecipient` objects
in much the same way as [`Person`] objects are used when sending
e-mails with [`send_email()`].  (See the
[`.email_address()`] method for [`Person`] objects).

### <a name="DAEmailRecipient.exists"></a>`.exists()`

The `.exists()` method returns `True` if the `.address` attribute has
been defined, and `False` otherwise.

## <a name="DAEmailRecipientList"></a>DAEmailRecipientList

A `DAEmailRecipientList` is a [`DAList`] of [`DAEmailRecipient`] objects.

## <a name="DALazyTemplate"></a>DALazyTemplate

The [`template`] block allows you to store some text to a variable.
The variable will be defined as an object of the `DALazyTemplate`
class.

Objects of this type have two read-only attributes:

* `content`
* `subject`

When **docassemble** shows a [`template`], it assembles any [Mako] in
the `content` and optional `subject` attributes as the resulting text.
Note that the text may have [Markdown]<span></span> [markup] in it.

<a name="DALazyTemplate.show"></a>If a template is a variable
`disclaimer`, the content can be inserted by writing
`${ disclaimer }`, `${ disclaimer.content }`, or
`${ disclaimer.show() }`.  The latter method facilitates the use of
[`DALazyTemplate`]s and [`DAFile`]s interchangably.

You can also use `show()` to pass variables to a template.  The
template can still access variables in the interview answers, but the
names you pass will take precedence over any names that already
exist.  Passing these variables will not change the interview
answers.  You cannot pass variables that use indexes (`[]`) or
attributes (`.`).

{% include side-by-side.html demo="template-show" %}

If called from within a DOCX file, `show()` returns paragraph-level
text converted from Markdown.

The `show_as_markdown()` method works just like `show()`, except that
when called from a DOCX file, it does not return paragraph-level text.
You can pass the results through the `markdown` filter or the
`inline_markdown` filter depending on how you want the results
formatted.

For more information about how
`DALazyTemplate` objects work when embedded into DOCX files, see the
section on [Inserting multi-line or formatted text into a single field
in a DOCX file].

<a name="DALazyTemplate.subject_as_html"></a><a
name="DALazyTemplate.content_as_html"></a>If you write Python modules
that generate [HTML], you may wish to use
`disclaimer.subject_as_html()` and `disclaimer.content_as_html()`.
These methods return [HTML] instead of [Markdown].

The `DALazyTemplate` is called a "lazy" object because its `content`
and `subject` attributes are evaluated not when the object is defined,
but whenever it is displayed.  This allows you to define a template,
the content of which depends on whatever the current state of the
interview answers is, and you can re-use the template in a variety of
contexts.

For more information about using [`DALazyTemplate`]s, see the
documentation on the [`template`].  Also, see the documentation for
[`send_email()`] and [`send_sms()`].

## <a name="DATemplate"></a><a name="DATemplate.show"></a>DATemplate

The [`DATemplate`] is like the [`DALazyTemplate`], except that its
`subject` and `content` attributes are static.

## <a name="DAEmpty"></a>DAEmpty

The `DAEmpty` object is designed to stand in place of an object that
might otherwise have important attributes, but it will always return
an empty string whenever the interview tries to access its
attributes.

So if `exemption` is a `DAEmpty` object, `exemption.amount` will
return `''`, as will `exemption[2]`,
`exemption[4].authority.address.unit`, etc.

This object is used internally by the [`item()`](#DAList.item) method.
It can also be useful to use the `DAEmpty` object if you have a
template that refers to variables that you decide you don't actually
want to use.  If your interview simply sets those variables to
`DAEmpty`, your template will not trigger an error.

The `DAEmpty` object is not a type of `DAObject`.

Optionally, you can use a different textual representation than the
empty string `''`.  If you initialize the object as `DAEmpty(str='not
applicable')`, then `'not applicable'` will be used in place of the
empty string.

## <a name="DACatchAll"></a>DACatchAll

The `DACatchAll` is a special class used internally by the [catchall
questions] feature.  If the definition of an undefined variable is
sought, and no block exists in the interview that defines it, the
variable will be initialized as a `DACatchAll` object.  The
`DACatchAll` is a subclass of `DAObject`.

Like a [`DAObject`], the `DACatchAll` can exist without having any
substance.  But when `str()` or `int()` is called on the object, the
the `value` attribute is returned.  Thus you can write [`generic
object`] questions that define `x.value`.  The `DACatchAll` class
overrides built-in methods like `__str__()` and `__int__()` and sets
the `context` attribute to `'str'`, `'int'`, etc. so that your
[`generic object`] questions know the context in which the value was
sought.  If the method is something like `__add__()` that takes a
parameter, the `operand` attribute is set to that parameter.

For more information on how `DACatchAll` is used, see the [catchall
questions] subsection.

## <a name="DALink"></a>DALink

The `DALink` class represents a [hyperlink] to a [URL].  It has two
properties:

* `url`: the [URL] to which the link points.
* `anchor_text`: the text of the link that the user sees.

In most circumstances, it is not necessary to use a `DALink` to
represent a [hyperlink] because you can use [Markdown] to indicate a
hyperlink. In a [`docx template file`] template, you can write:

> For more information, visit {% raw %}{{r the_link \| inline_markdown }}{% endraw %}.
{: .blockquote}

A `DALink` object is another way that you can insert a hyperlink into
a [`docx template file`].

{% include side-by-side.html demo="dalink" %}

If you want your hyperlinks to look like hyperlinks, you will need to
make sure that your DOCX template has a character style for
hyperlinks. In the DOCX template in the above example,
[`dalink.docx`], a character style for hyperlinks is defined, and that
is why the link appears with color and underlining. For more
information, see the section on [hyperlink style].

## <a name="DARedis"></a>DARedis

The `DARedis` class facilitates the use of [Redis] for in-memory
storage.

{% include side-by-side.html demo="redis" %}

For the most part, an object of type `DARedis` functions just like an
object created through `redis.StrictRedis()` using the standard
[Python] package called [`redis`].  You can use methods like `.set()`,
`.get()`, `.delete()`, `.incr()`, etc.

However, there are three additional methods that facilitate the use of
[Redis] in the context of **docassemble** interviews.

<a name="DARedis.key"></a>The `key()` method is a convenience function
for obtaining keys that you can use as [Redis] keys in order to avoid
name collisions across interviews.  Given a key like
`'favorite_fruit'`, it returns the key with a prefix based on the
interview, like
`docassemble.food:data/questions/fruit.yml:favorite_fruit`.  You could
use `favorite_fruit` as a key, but if another interview on the system
used the same key, the interviews would interfere with one another.

<a name="DARedis.set_data"></a><a name="DARedis.get_data"></a>The
`set_data()` and `get_data()` methods act just like the standard
methods `set()` and `get()`, except that they perform [pickling] and
unpickling.  This allows you to store and retrieve **docassemble**
objects or any type of data structure that is able to be [pickled].
The `set_data()` method takes an optional keyword argument `expire`,
which you can set to an integer representing the number of seconds
after which the data should be removed from [Redis].

{% include side-by-side.html demo="redis-data" %}

## <a name="DAStore"></a>DAStore

The `DAStore` is similar to `DARedis`, except it stores data in [SQL] and
it allows for encryption.  It is also similar in functionality to the
`write_record()` and `read_records()` functions.

`DAStore` objects provide an interface to a database based on keys and
values (like [Redis]).  The keys are strings and the values are any
[Python] objects that can be [pickled].  Unlike the interview answers,
which are tied to a particular session, the information in this
database is global and can be accessed from any interview.

{% include side-by-side.html demo="dastore" %}

In the above example, the user's preferences are stored in the
database using a key that is specific to the user.  The first time the
user uses the interview, the user is asked for their favorite fruit.
If the user restarts the interview (which permanently erases the
interview answers), the user's favorite fruit will be retrieved from
the `DAStore`, and it will not need to be asked of the user.

The object stored in the database is a [`DAObject`], and the favorite
fruit is an attribute of that object.  In the database, the object is
stored under a key containing the word `'prefs'`.  This key is
specific to the user, so that each user will have their own personal
`'prefs'` entry in the database.

In the above interview, the object `preferences` is just a `DAObject`
with no special properties.  It is an object stored in the interview
answers.  You can consider it a "working copy" of the object that is
stored in the database.  It is initialized by this YAML:

{% highlight yaml %}
objects:
  - userdata: DAStore
  - preferences: DAObject
---
code: |
  if userdata.defined("prefs"):
    preferences = userdata.get("prefs")
{% endhighlight %}

This means "set the variable `preferences` to the object stored in the
database under the key `"prefs"`, but if the `"prefs"` key does not
exist, then fall back to initializing `preferences` as an empty
`DAObject`.

The interview logic (the `mandatory`<span> </span>`code` blocks)
ensures that `preferences.favorite_fruit` exists.  If
`preferences.favorite_fruit` is not defined, the `question` will be
asked.  Then the `code` block will save the `preferences` object to
the database, but only if there is no database entry for `"prefs"`.

Note that in the final block of the interview, the `subquestion`
refers to `userdata.get("prefs").favorite_fruit` instead of
`preferences.favorite_fruit`.  This is because `preferences` was only
ever a "working copy" for purposes of 1) checking to see if
`favorite_fruit` was defined, and 2) populating the database if no
preferences had been stored yet.  Calling
`userdata.get("prefs").favorite_fruit` instead of
`preferences.favorite_fruit` ensures that the `question` always
returns the user's favorite fruit, even if it had been changed since
the `preferences` "working copy" was created.

Here is a different example, where the user's preferences are a
`DADict` and the interview merely updates the preferences after asking
for the user's favorite fruit.

{% include side-by-side.html demo="dastore2" %}

In this example, the `prefsdict` dictionary might be used in numerous
interviews and contain many different key/value pairs.  Each interview
that uses the `prefsdict` dictionary would not need to know about all
the other key/value pairs; it just updates the key/value pairs that it
works with. Also, note that in this example interview, the user is
always asked for their favorite fruit, even if there is a
`favorite_fruit` preference in the `prefsdict` storage area.

A user can have any number of unique keys in the database.  Typically,
it makes sense to use a single key to store a number of different
objects.  For example, you can store a [`DAObject`] and keep different
pieces of information in the attributes, or you can store a [`DADict`]
and keep different pieces of information in the values of the
dictionary.

By default, information stored in this database is encrypted, so that
only the user who stored the information can retrieve it.  An
exception will be raised if an attempt is made to access an encrypted
record using the incorrect encryption key.  As with the interview
answers, the encryption key is based on the user's password (or a
randomly-generted key if the user is not logged in).

Assume you have a `DAStore` object called `mystore`.

{% highlight yaml %}
objects:
  - mystore: DAStore
{% endhighlight %}

<a name="DAStore.get"></a>If you call `mystore.get('fruit')`, you will
retrieve the object from storage that is stored under the key
`'fruit'`.  If no such object exists, `None` will be returned.

<a name="DAStore.set"></a>If you call `mystore.set('fruit',
favorite_fruit)`, you will save the object `favorite_fruit` under the
key `'fruit'`.

<a name="DAStore.delete"></a>If you call `mystore.delete('fruit')`, it
will delete the record from the database for the key `'fruit'`.  No
error is raised if the record did not exist.

<a name="DAStore.defined"></a>If you call `mystore.defined('fruit')`,
it will return `True` if an object is stored under the key `'fruit'`
and `False` otherwise.

<a name="DAStore.is_encrypted"></a>If you call
`mystore.is_encrypted()`, it will return `True` or `False` depending
on whether encryption is enabled for the data store.

<a name="DAStore.keys"></a>If you call `mystore.keys()`, it will
return a list of keys that exist in the data store.

The operations of the `DAStore` object can be configured using two
optional attributes: `base` and `encrypted`.

<a name="DAStore.base"></a>**docassemble** stores `DAStore` data in a
[SQL] table where each record is identified by a "key" that is a string
(similarly to the way [Redis] works).  The key that you pass to the
`get()`, `set()`, `delete()`, and `defined()` methods makes up part of
this key, but it is not the only part of it; there is a prefix that
comes before it.  The `base` attribute determines what this prefix is,
and also determines whether the object should be encrypted by default.
For a storage object `mystore`, you can set `mystore.base` to:

* `'user'` - The prefix will be based on the user's ID.  (If the user
  is not logged in, but then registers, the key will be automatically
  re-assigned to the logged-in user's ID.)  By default, the objects
  will be encrypted.
* `'interview'` - The prefix will be based on the interview name
  (e.g., `docassemble.demo:data/questions/questions.yml`).  By
  default, the objects will not be encrypted.  Using `'interview'` as
  the prefix can be helpful if users on your server use interviews
  created by multiple interview developers.  It will avoid a situation
  where, for example, two developers both use `'prefs'` as the key for
  a common data store, and there are conflicts between the way that
  the objects are used.
* `'session'` - The prefix will be based on a combination of the
  interview name (e.g.,
  `docassemble.demo:data/questions/questions.yml`) and the session ID.
  By default, the objects will be encrypted.  In this mode, the
  objects will be specific to the session, meaning that if the user
  presses the back button, the value of the objects will be
  preserved.  However, if the user restarts the session, the session
  ID will change, so the saved objects will be unavailable.
* `'global'` - Effectively, this means there is no prefix.  From any
  interview on your server, regardless of who the user is, calling
  `mystore.get('fruit')` will retrieve the same object.
* A string of your own choosing.  For example, if you have a
  collection of family law interviews and a collection of consumer law
  interviews, and the key names you are using overlap between these
  two collections, but you want the data to be separate for each
  collection, you could use `'family'` as the `base` in the family law
  interviews, and `'consumer'` as the `base` in the consumer law
  interviews.  Then the data would be isolated between the two
  collections, but common within each collection.  By default,
  encryption is disabled when you use a string of your own choosing as
  the `base`.

If you do not specify a `.base`, the `'user'` method will be used.
This is why, in the example above, the unique key was specific to the
user.

<a name="DAStore.encrypted"></a>If you want to override the defaults
on whether the objects are encrypted, you can set the `encrypted`
attribute to `True` if you want encryption, and `False` if you do not
want encryption.

You can set these attributes when you initialize the object:

{% highlight yaml %}
objects:
  - mystore: DAStore.using(base='global')
{% endhighlight %}

If you want to use different settings for different keys, you can
include more than one `DAStore` variable in your interview.

## <a name="DAGlobal"></a>DAGlobal

The `DAGlobal` is a type of `DAObject` that stores its attributes in a
global, unencrypted area of the SQL database rather than in the
interview answers. A `DAGlobal` object can be used to share a Python
object across multiple sessions. With a `DAGlobal` object, you do not
need to manually retrieve and save (as you do with a `DAStore`); the
"retrieve" happens automatically when the server loads the interview
answers, and the "save" happens automatically when the server saves
the interview answers (similar to the way a [`SQLObject`] works).

Here is an example interview that lets you explore how the `DAGlobal`
object works.

{% include demo-side-by-side.html demo="daglobal" %}

The `DAGlobal` object takes two attributes, which should be defined at
the time the object is created (e.g., with `.using()`):

* `key` - the textual identifier for the object. The default is a
  random alphanumeric string, but that is not very useful so you
  should always specify a key of your own.
* `base` - can be one of `'global'`, `'interview'`, or `'user'`. This
  indicates the scope in which the `key` will operate. The default is
  `'user'`.

The `'global'` scope indicates that the `DAGlobal` object is "global"
across the entire server. If the `base` is `'global'`, then regardless
of what interview is being used, who the user is, and what the session
is, `DAGlobal` objects with the same `key` will always have the same
attributes.

The `'interview'` scope indicates that the `DAGlobal` object is
"global" across sessions in the current interview (the YAML file for
starting the interview). If a user has multiple sessions in the
current interview, and another user also has a session of their own in
the same interview, then even though these are all separate sessions,
the `DAGlobal` object will be the same across them all.

The `'user'` scope indicates that the `DAGlobal` object is "global"
across all sessions belonging to the current user.

If you want to use custom scopes, you can adopt a convention of adding
prefixes to your `key`. (Internally, this is what the `base` attribute
does inside the `DAGlobal` class.)

The data associated with a `DAGlobal` object will persist if the
interview answers are deleted. Objects with the `base` of `'user'`
will be deleted if the user deletes their account. To delete the data
associated with a `DAGlobal` object, you can call the `.delete()`
method on it. This will delete the object from storage and also delete
all of the attributes of the Python object.

The `DAGlobal` class supports some helpful class methods.

Calling `DAGlobal.keys(the_base)` will return a list of defined keys
for the given base (`'global'`, `'interview'`, or `'user'`).

Calling `DAGlobal.keys(the_base, the_key)` will return `True` or
`False` depending on whether the given key is defined within the given
base.

Note that these are class methods, not instance methods.

Since the data associated with a `DAGlobal` object is not stored in
the interview answers, but is stored instead on a "global" area, there
is no versioning as there is with the regular interview answers. There
is always just one copy of the data. As a result, using a `DAGlobal`
object in your interview logic can cause unexpected behavior when the
user presses the back button. Pressing the back button restores the
previous version of the interview answers, which ordinarily results in
the user seeing the screen they saw before. However, since the
`DAGlobal` data is always retrieved from a global area, rather than
from the interview answers, the attributes of the `DAGlobal` object
will be the same despite the back button.

It is generally advisable to use `DAGlobal` objects for things the
user might expect to be unaffected by the back button, such as a "user
profile."  Here is an example of an interview that provides an
interface for editing a "profile" for the user.

{% include demo-side-by-side.html demo="globalprofile" %}

After you complete the above interview, if you go into a separate
interview that has a `DAGlobal` object with the same `base` and `key`,
you will see the same data.

{% include demo-side-by-side.html demo="globalprofile2" %}

Note that if you restart your session in one of these interviews
(which deletes the interview answers of the current session and starts
a new session), you can see that your data in the `DAGlobal` object
persists.

The above interview uses a [`review`] screen based on `continue button
field` variables to take the user to different screens. This style is
used because it maintains the back button functionality that users
expect. If the interview had been written without `continue button
field` variables, it would have looked like this:

{% include demo-side-by-side.html demo="globalprofile3" %}

In this example, the [`review`] screen with `skip undefined: False`
will cause `profile.user.name.first`, `profile.user.address.address`,
and `profile.preferences.favorite_fruit` to be defined before the user
can see the [`review`] screen. This works as long as the user only
goes forward. But if you try pressing the back button after defining
one of these variables, you will see that the screen does not change.

Here are some possible applications of a `DAGlobal` object:

* Storing basic information about the user in a form that follows them
  from session to session, using a `DAGlobal` object with `'user'` as
  the `base`. You could develop an editing interface for this basic
  information, package it in a YAML file, and then [`include`] that
  YAML file into all of your interviews, so that the user can edit
  their basic information from inside of any session.
* Aggregating responses to questions in a given interview. For
  example, you could conduct a poll by incrementing integer attributes
  of a `DAGlobal` object with `'interview'` as the `base`. You could
  make one of the attributes of a `DAGlobal` object a Python `set` and
  `.add()` items to it, building a "crowdsourced" set of items that
  could be used as the choices in a multiple choice question.
* Track usage statistics across your server by incrementing integer
  attributes of a `DAGlobal` object with `'global'` as the `base`.

Note that the `DAGlobal` object, like the `DAStore` object, is not
meant to be a replacement for a database. If you need to maintain a
large database, storing large amounts of data in a pickled object is
not a good idea. Instead, you should call the API of third-party
database software, or use a [`SQLObject`] tied to a real SQL database.

## <a name="DACloudStorage"></a>DACloudStorage

The `DACloudStorage` object allows you to access low-level
functionality of cloud storage using [Amazon S3] or [Azure blob
storage], using the [boto3] and [azure.storage.blob] libraries,
respectively.

Suppose you include the following in your interview:

{% highlight yaml %}
objects:
  - cloud: DACloudStorage
{% endhighlight %}

If you have enabled [`s3`] in your [Configuration], then:

* `cloud.conn` will return a [`boto3.resource('s3')`] object initialized
  according to the [`s3`] configuration.
* `cloud.client` will return a [`boto3.client('s3')`] object initialized
  according to the [`s3`] configuration.
* `cloud.bucket` will return a [`Bucket`] object for the bucket
  defined in the [`s3`] configuration.
* `cloud.bucket_name` will return the name of the bucket defined in
  the [`s3`] configuration.

If you have enabled [`azure`] in your [Configuration], then:

* `cloud.conn` will return a [`BlockBlobService()`] object initialized
  according to the [`azure`] configuration.
* `cloud.container_name` will return the name of the container defined
  in the [`azure`] configuration.

In some circumstances, you might not be using [`s3`] or [`azure`] for
persistent storage, or you may wish to access a different bucket or
container.  In that case, you can initialize the `DACloudStorage`
object so that it uses a different directive in the [Configuration].

For example, if you have an [S3 bucket] called `mybucket-example-com`,
and your [Configuration] contains the following:

{% highlight yaml %}
mybucket:
  access key id: AGJBRKYM3T4FY7HYWNBQ
  secret access key: BkwEQeg+yeC3EJ2MoCDwY8jbiWrtKdLf4q3++EBd
  bucket: mybucket-example-com
{% endhighlight %}

Then you can initialize a `DACloudStorage` object as follows:

{% highlight yaml %}
objects:
  - cloud: DACloudStorage.using(provider='s3', config='mybucket')
{% endhighlight %}

Then, you can use the `cloud` object to access the contents of the
`mybucket-example-com` bucket in your interview.  For example:

{% highlight yaml %}
question: |
  How to seek help
subquestion: |
  ${ cloud.bucket.Object('markdown_files/help.md').get()['Body'].read().decode('utf-8') }
{% endhighlight %}

In this example, the `subquestion` incorporates the contents of a
file called `help.md` located in the `markdown_files` folder of the
`mybucket-example-com` bucket.

For more information on how to use these objects, see the
documentation for [boto3] and [azure.storage.blob].

The `DACloudStorage` object simply provides a convenient way to obtain
an authenticated API connection to [Amazon S3] or [Azure blob
storage].  If you do not use a `DACloudStorage` object, you can still
use the [boto3] and [azure.storage.blob] packages; the only added
complication is that you have to handle authentication yourself.  You
can use the [`get_config()`] function to retrieve custom values from
your [Configuration].

For example, here is a [Python module] that defines a function that
retrieves a list of object names from an existing [S3 bucket].

{% highlight python %}
import boto3
import docassemble.base.util

s3_config = docassemble.base.util.get_config('manual s3 configuration')

def list_keys(prefix):
    conn = boto3.resource('s3', region_name='us-east-1', aws_access_key_id=s3_config['access key id'], aws_secret_access_key=s3_config['secret access key'])
    client = boto3.client('s3', region_name='us-east-1', aws_access_key_id=s3_config['access key id'], aws_secret_access_key=s3_config['secret access key'])
    bucket = conn.Bucket('example-com-data-bucket')
    output = list()
    for item in bucket.objects.filter(Prefix=prefix, Delimiter='/'):
        output.append(item.key)
    return output
{% endhighlight %}

This assumes you have a custom directive in your [Configuration] that
looks like this:

{% highlight yaml %}
manual s3 configuration:
  access key id: FWIEJFIJIDGISEJFWOEF
  secret access key: RGERG34eeeg3agwetTR0+wewWAWEFererNRERERG
{% endhighlight %}

## <a name="DAOAuth"></a>DAOAuth

The `DAOAuth` objects facilitates using [OAuth2] authentication in the
context of an interview.

{% include demo-side-by-side.html demo="oauth-test" %}

Although [OAuth2] is fairly complicated, the way that **docassemble**
handles it is fairly simple. There are two main things that the
`DAOAuth` object does: first, it uses the [`response()`] function to
trigger a browser redirect to the third-party [OAuth2] process if the
user has missing or invalid credientials; second, the [OAuth2] site
redirects the user back to the interview (at `/interview` on the
**docassemble** site, or whatever the base URL returned by
`interview_url()` is) and the `url_args` dictionary is used to
retrieve the access token obtained during the [OAuth2] process.

In the above example, the user needs to be logged in because the
[OAuth2] credentials are stored globally using [Redis] using the
user's e-mail address as part of the key. However, a later example
will demonstrate how to use identifiers other than the user's e-mail
address.

To follow this example and use a `DAOAuth` object to connect to
Google, you need to use the [Google Developers Console] and enable the
"Google Sheets API." Under Credentials, create an "OAuth client ID"
for a "web application." Assuming your server is at
https://interview.example.com, add `https://interview.example.com` to
the "Authorized JavaScript origins." Then, under "Authorized redirect
URIs," add `https://interview.example.com/interview` (or
`https://interview.example.com/run/yourshortcut` if you are using a
shortcut). Make a note of the "Client ID" and the "Client secret"
because you will need to plug those values into the [Configuration]

The module `oauthsheets.py` contains the following:

{% highlight python %}
from docassemble.base.util import DAOAuth
from googleapiclient.discovery import build

__all__ = ['GoogleAuth']

class GoogleAuth(DAOAuth):
    def init(self, *pargs, **kwargs):
        super().init(*pargs, **kwargs)
        self.appname = 'mygoogle'
        self.token_uri = "https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v4/token"
        self.auth_uri = "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/v2/auth"
        self.scope = "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/spreadsheets"
    def test(self):
        service = build('sheets', 'v4', http=self.get_http())
        SAMPLE_SPREADSHEET_ID = '1BxiMVs0XRA5nFMdKvBdBZjgmUUqptlbs74OgvE2upms'
        SAMPLE_RANGE_NAME = 'Class Data!A2:E'
        sheet = service.spreadsheets()
        result = sheet.values().get(spreadsheetId=SAMPLE_SPREADSHEET_ID,
                                    range=SAMPLE_RANGE_NAME).execute()
        values = result.get('values', [])
        return values
{% endhighlight %}

This example connects to Google, but note that [OAuth2] is a general
protocol used by a number of authentication providers.

The `GoogleAuth` class is a subclass of `DAOAuth`. The following four
attributes must be defined:

* `appname` - This is a name that you choose.  Credentials will be
  stored based on this application name as well as the user's e-mail
  address.  In this example, the application name is `mygoogle`.
* `token_uri` - This is the URL for obtaining the [OAuth2] token. It
  should be provided in the documentation for the [OAuth2] API.
* `auth_uri` - This is the URL for [OAuth2] authorization. It
  should be provided in the documentation for the [OAuth2] API.
* `scope` - This is the scope of access you are requesting. The
  format should be documented in the documentation for the [OAuth2]
  API.

Since the application name is `mygoogle`, you need to edit your
[Configuration] to add the "Client ID" and "Client secret" under the
`oauth` directive as follows:

{% highlight yaml %}
oauth:
  mygoogle:
    id: 18761224589-4t28ji14udf7pa39hd5ssqdttebt959y.apps.googleusercontent.com
    secret: UnDdE_EBOft7wYU8rmCFXTdy
{% endhighlight %}

Note that in the interview, the object was defined with
`.using(url_args=url_args)`, and that the "redirect URI" was
`/interview`. This is all necessary because after the [OAuth2]
process, the [OAuth2] provider will redirect back to your interview
with the URL parameters `state` and `code`. The `DAOAuth` object needs
to have a reference to the `url_args` so that it can read these URL
parameters.

Note that if the user has opened sessions in multiple different
interviews, when the user is redirected to `/interview`, they may
resume a different session. To avoid this, use `/start/` URLs to start
interview sessions and `/run/` URLs to resume interview sessions. This
is a limitation of [OAuth2], which does not allow URL parameters in
the URL to which the user is redirected.

If you need to modify the way `DAOAuth` works, you can copy and paste the
code for `DAOAuth` out of [`docassemble.base.util`] into your own module.

The methods of `DAOAuth` that are useful are:

* `.get_credentials()` - this returns credentials in the format used
  by `oauth2client.client`.
* `.get_http()` - this returns a `httplib2.Http()` object that has
  been modified so that it contains the necessary [OAuth2]
  credentials.  If the user it not authorized, this will cause
  authorization to be requested.
* `.ensure_authorized()` - this does not return anything, but it will
  cause authorization to be requested if there are no stored
  credentials or if the stored credentials are invalid.
* `.active()` - this will return `True` if there are stored
  credentials in the system for the user.  It will not test if the
  credentials are valid.
* `.is_authorized()` - this will return `True` if there are stored
  credentials in the system for the user and the credentials are
  valid.  It will not cause authorization to be requested.
* `.delete_credentials()` - this will delete the stored credentials
  from the system.

Here is a longer version of the interview above, demonstrating how to
add a menu item that allows the users to manage their credentials.

{% include demo-side-by-side.html demo="oauth-test-2" %}

By default, the `DAOAuth` object will remember the user's credentials
for six months. To set a different period, you can set the `expires`
attribute to an integer number of seconds or to `None` if the
credentials should be remembered forever. Here is an example of
storing credentials for one week:

{% highlight yaml %}
objects:
  - google: GoogleAuth.using(url_args=url_args, expires=60*60*24*7)
{% endhighlight %}

The examples above have demonstrated using the logged-in user's e-mail
address as the identifier for storing the credentials. This is the
default behavior. The advantage is that a given user only needs to go
through the oauth process once and then they will connect
automatically in the future, even in different sessions and
interviews.

However, you might want to use an [OAuth2] process for a non-logged-in
user, or you might want a different unique ID than the user's e-mail
address. You can set a custom `unique_id` to be used instead.

{% highlight yaml %}
objects:
  - google: GoogleAuth.using(url_args=url_args, unique_id=process_number)
---
code: |
  process_number = some_custom_api_call()
{% endhighlight %}

You might use this in a situation where an external server initializes
the session using the [API] and populates the unique ID as a variable
in the interview answers. In this situation, you would need to prevent
users from initiating a session if that unique ID was not defined.
Here is one way to do it.

{% highlight python %}
# get the session ID of a new session
r = requests.get(server + '/api/session/new', params={'key': api_key, 'i': interviewname})
session_id = r.json()['session']

# pre-populate the user_id variable in the interview answers of the session
r = requests.post(server + '/api/session', data={'key': api_key, 'i': interviewname, 'session': session_id, 'variables': json.dumps({'initialized': true, 'user_id': user_id})})

# obtain a URL for directing the user to the session
r = requests.post(root + '/api/resume_url', data={'key': key, 'i': interviewname, 'session': session_id})
url = r.json()
{% endhighlight %}

The interview would then use the `initialized` variable to control
whether a user can have access.

{% highlight yaml %}
objects:
  - google: GoogleAuth.using(url_args=url_args, unique_id=user_id)
---
mandatory: True
code: |
  multi_user = True
  if not initialized:
    kick_out
---
code: |
  initialized = False
---
event: kick_out
question: Go away
---
mandatory: True
code: |
  intro_screen
---
question: |
  You need to connect with Google Sheets.
subquestion: |
  Press Continue to connect.
field: intro_screen
---
code: |
  if google.active():
    intro_screen = True
{% endhighlight %}

If you only need the [OAuth2] connection to survive for the duration
of the session, you can set `use_random_unique_id=True` in the
configuration, and a randomly-generated `unique_id` will be set.

{% include demo-side-by-side.html demo="oauth-test-3" %}

If you set a custom `unique_id` or you set `use_random_unique_id` to
true, then the default expiration time for the credentials is 24 hours
rather than six months.

<a name="DAOAuth.authorize"></a>If you are using a [`DAWeb`] for
communication with an API that requires [OAuth2] authentication, you
can add something like the following to the top of your YAML:

{% highlight yaml %}
objects:
  - auth: MyAuth.using(url_args=url_args)
  - api: DAWeb
---
initial: True
code: |
  auth.authorize(api)
{% endhighlight %}

Here, `auth` is an instance of your `DAOAuth` subclass, and `api` is
an instance of the [`DAWeb`] class.  Running `auth.authorize(api)`
will perform the [OAuth2] process if necessary, and then it will
define a default header in your [`DAWeb`] instance that will authorize
requests to the API.  It is important that `.authorize()` always run
in the same screen load as any calls to the web API.  This interview
achieves this by running `.authorize()` every time the screen loads
(with `initial: True`).  This means that if the token has expired, it
will be refreshed.

## <a name="DAWeb"></a>DAWeb

The `DAWeb` object facilitates making requests to APIs.

{% include side-by-side.html demo="daweb" %}

In this example, the `.get()` method makes [GET] requests to API
that provides information about the [SpaceX] company.  The two API
URLs that are called are:

* [https://api.spacexdata.com/v3/launches/latest](https://api.spacexdata.com/v3/launches/latest)
* [https://api.spacexdata.com/v3/ships?ship_type=Tug](https://api.spacexdata.com/v3/ships?ship_type=Tug)

You could make these calls yourself in code using the [`requests`]
module, which is very easy to use.  The `DAWeb` object is effectively
a front end for [`requests`].  The purpose of `DAWeb` is to allow you
to call APIs from within interviews while keeping your code readable.
The `DAWeb` object lets you set default values for things like the
base URL of the API and what headers or cookies to use, so that your
calls to the APIs can be written in succinct code.

A single `DAWeb` object can be re-used throughout your interview to
call different API endpoints.  The object stores default values and
provide methods that you can call.

The following methods are supported:

* `.get()` - makes a [GET] request
* `.post()` - makes a [POST] request
* `.delete()` - makes a [DELETE] request
* `.put()` - makes a [PUT] request
* `.patch()` - makes a [PATCH] request
* `.options()` - makes a [OPTIONS] request
* `.head()` - makes a [HEAD] request

Each of these methods has a single required parameter, which is the
URL.  You can give it a full URL:

{% highlight yaml %}
objects:
  - web: DAWeb
---
code: |
  launch = web.get("https://api.spacexdata.com/v3/launches/latest")
{% endhighlight %}

If you set the `base_url` attribute of the object, you can call the
`.get()` method with an easier-to-read URL fragment, and keep the
`https://` part in your object initializer:

{% highlight yaml %}
objects:
  - web: DAWeb.using(base_url="https://api.spacexdata.com/v3")
---
code: |
  launch = web.get("launches/latest")
{% endhighlight %}

You do not have to worry about putting a `/` at the end of the
`base_url` or at the beginning of a relative URL; whether you include
a `/` or not, it will figure out what the correct URL should be.

The methods also accept a number of optional keyword parameters.  The
most import optional keyword parameter is `data`.  Set this to a
[`dict`] or [`DADict`] containing the URL parameters or form fields
that you want to include in the request.

{% highlight yaml %}
code: |
  launch = web.get('ships', data={'ship_type': 'Tug'})
{% endhighlight %}

This results in a [GET] request to the URL
`https://api.spacexdata.com/v3/ships?ship_type=Tug`.  The URI encoding
of the parameters is handled automatically.

The `data` parameter is also used to pass data when making [POST]
requests:

{% highlight yaml %}
code: |
  result = web.post('https://api.example.com/new_user', data={'name': 'Fred'})
{% endhighlight %}

The `data` parameter will be converted to [JSON] and passed as the
body of the POST request using `application/json` as the [content
type].  If the API cannot accept data in this format, you can set
`json_body` to `False`.  With `json_body` set to `False`, the more
traditional method of sending form data is used, where the [content
type] is `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`.  In this case, the
`data` parameter must be a dictionary.

{% highlight yaml %}
code: |
  result = web.post('https://api.example.com/new_user', data={'name': 'Fred'}, json_body=False)
{% endhighlight %}

To upload a file, set the `files` keyword parameter to a dictionary
where the keys are the names of the fields the server is expecting and
the values are references to files.  You can refer to **docassemble**
file-like objects (e.g., [`DAFile`], [`DAStaticFile`]) or references
to files in a package (e.g., `'picture_of_fred.png'` or
`'docassemble.missouri:data/static/picture_of_fred.png'`).  File
system paths are not accepted.

{% highlight yaml %}
question: |
  Please upload a picture of ${ user }.
fields:
  - Picture: user.portrait
    datatype: file
---
code: |
  result = web.post('https://api.example.com/image',
                    data={'name': user.name.full()},
                    files={'portrait': user.portrait})
{% endhighlight %}

In this case, the API at the `/image` [POST] endpoint is expecting to
receive a file upload using the field name `portrait`.

When using [GET], [DELETE], [HEAD], and [OPTIONS], you can only pass
information to the API using URL parameters, but when using [POST],
[PUT], and [PATCH], you can use both URL parameters and form data to
send information to the API.  If you need to set URL parameters when
sending form data with `.post()`, `.patch()`, or `.put()`, you can set
the `params` parameter to a dictionary of URL parameters, while
setting the `data` parameter to a dictionary of information that you
want to send in the body of the request.

{% highlight yaml %}
code: |
  result = web.post('https://api.example.com/user', params={'action': 'new'}, data={'name': 'Fred'})
{% endhighlight %}

You can also use the keyword parameter `params` instead of `data` when
using `.get()`, `.delete()`, `etc.`

You can set a default value for the `json_body` keyword argument by
setting the `json_body` attribute of the object:

{% highlight yaml %}
objects:
  - web: DAWeb.using(base_url="https://api.example.com", json_body=False)
{% endhighlight %}

All of the keyword parameters (except for `data`, `params`, and
`files`) work the same way; if you want to set a default value for a
parameter, you just set the attribute of the object, and then the
value will be used in every method call you make.  Thus, the method
calls you make in your interview can be succinct and free of
repetition.  If you ever need to override the default value in a
special case, you can just set the keyword parameter when calling the
method.

With the `headers` attribute (or keyword parameter), you can add
special headers to a request.  For example, if you want to masquerade
as a Firefox browser, you can set the `User-Agent` header.

{% highlight yaml %}
objects:
  - web: DAWeb.using(base_url='https://api.spacexdata.com/v3',
                   headers={'User-Agent': 'Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:68.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/68.0'})
{% endhighlight %}

If your API uses [Basic Auth] or [Digest Auth], you can pass your
credentials using the `auth` attribute (or keyword parameter).  It
should refer to a dictionary with three keys: `type`, `username`, and
`password`.

{% highlight yaml %}
objects:
  - web: DAWeb.using(base_url='https://api.example.com', auth={'type': 'basic', 'username': 'jsmith', 'password': 'xxsecret'})
{% endhighlight %}

To use [Basic Auth], set `type` to `'basic'`.  To use [Digest Auth],
set `type` to `'digest'`.  If you don't specify a `type`, `'basic'` is
assumed.

Similarly, if your API uses [bearer token authentication], you can set
`auth` to a dictionary where `'type'` is `'bearer'` and `'token'` is
your bearer token.

{% highlight yaml %}
objects:
  - web: |
      DAWeb.using(base_url='https://api.example.com',
                  auth={'type': 'bearer',
                        'token': 'uweoDS0iBfirGwesB.8d29230fa55b5c5deb2f87a82b3f6d2f4ab25c2b7e34b563d3b8fb84532c254b'})
{% endhighlight %}

It is generally a good idea not to put passwords in source code.  You
can store your credentials in the [Configuration] and use the
`get_config()` function to retrieve them.  You can put this in your
Configuration:

{% highlight yaml %}
example.com credentials:
  type: basic
  username: jsmith
  password: xxsecret
{% endhighlight %}

This [YAML] specifies a dictionary.  When you call
`get_config('example.com credentials')`, it will return the dictionary
`{'type': 'basic', 'username': 'jsmith', 'password': 'xxsecret'}`.
Thus, you can write:

{% highlight yaml %}
objects:
  - web: DAWeb.using(base_url='https://api.example.com', auth=get_config('example.com credentials'))
{% endhighlight %}

If the API you are calling relies on a cookie being set, you can set
the `cookies` attribute to a dictionary containing your cookie values.

{% highlight yaml %}
objects:
  - web: DAWeb.using(base_url='https://api.example.com', cookies={'X-Auth-Secret': '5tTy34SfTeG3e'})
{% endhighlight %}

If you set a `cookies` attribute, then every time the API is called,
any new cookies set by the server will be updated in the `cookies`
attribute, so that the next time you use the `DAWeb` object to call
the API, these cookies will be sent.  This can be useful if the server
needs its own cookies in order to function correctly.  By contrast, if
you only set the cookies in a keyword parameter when calling a method,
then the `cookies` attribute will not be updated.

If you are using an API that uses [OAuth2] authentication, see the
[`authorize()`] method of the [`DAOAuth`] class, discussed at the end
of the previous section.

The value returned by the method depends on whether the HTTP request
succeeded and the format of the data returned by the server.  Most API
servers return a [JSON] data structure.  The `DAWeb` methods will
convert that [JSON] data structure into a [Python] data structure and
return it.  If a request is not successful, `None` is returned.

By default, a request will be considered successful if the status code
returned by the server is between 200 and 299.  You can change this by
setting `success_code` to a specific value, or a list (or tuple) of
values:

{% highlight yaml %}
code: |
  result = web.post('new_user',
                    data={'name': 'Fred'},
                    success_code=204)
{% endhighlight %}

In this case, if the [POST] request results in a response with status
code 200, it will be treated as unsuccessful.

{% highlight yaml %}
code: |
  result = web.post('new_user',
                    data={'name': 'Fred'},
                    success_code=[200, 204])
{% endhighlight %}

In this case, if the [POST] request results in a response with a status
other than 200 or 204, it will be treated as unsuccessful.

One of the dangers of calling APIs in interviews is that you might
mistakenly call the API repeatedly.  Like the [`send_email()`]
function, `DAWeb` methods can mark a task as successful if the request
is successful.  You indicate the task by setting the `task` keyword
parameter.

{% highlight yaml %}
code: |
  if task_not_yet_performed('user_created'):
    web.post('new_user', data={'name': 'Fred'}, task='user_created')
{% endhighlight %}

If you set a `task`, you can optionally set the "persistence" of the
task by setting the `task_persistent` keyword parameter to `True` or
`False`.  The default is `False`.  For more information, see the
documentation for the [task-related functions].

You can control what is returned if a request is unsuccessful by
setting the `on_failure` attribute (or keyword parameter).  If you set
`on_failure` to `{'success': False}`, then that dictionary will be
returned in case of an error.  The default value is `None`, meaning
that `None` is returned in case the request is not successful.

<a name="DAWebError"></a>There are special values of `on_failure` that
you might want to use:

* if you set `on_failure` to `'text'`, then the UTF-8-decoded text
  response is returned.
* if you set `on_failure` to `'content'`, then the raw (not UTF-8 decoded)
  response is returned.
* if you set `on_failure` to `'raise'`, then if
  the request is unsuccessful, an exception of type `DAWebError` is
  raised, which you can trap:

{% highlight yaml %}
objects:
  - web: DAWeb.using(base_url='https://api.example.com', on_failure='raise')
---
code: |
  try:
    result = web.get('status')
  except DAWebError as e:
    log("Uh oh, the API returned status code " + str(e.status_code))
    result = False
{% endhighlight %}

The `DAWebError` object has the following attributes:

* `url`: the full URL to which the request was made
* `method`: the HTTP method that was used for the request
* `params`: the URL parameters that were sent in the request
* `data`: the data that were were sent in the body of the request (if applicable)
* `task`: the task that would have been marked as completed if the
  request was successful
* `task_persistent`: the value of `task_persistent` used during the
  call.
* `headers`: the headers that were sent in the request
* `status_code`: the status code of the response, or -1 if there no
  response (e.g., because of a network error)
* `response_text`: the raw text of the response
* `response_json`: the data structure of the response, if it was in
  JSON format
* `response_headers`: a dictionary containing the response headers
* `exception_type`: the name of the exception class, if a call to
  [`requests`] returned an exception
* `exception_text`: the text of the exception, if a call to [`requests`]
  returned an exception
* `cookies_before`: a dictionary containing the cookies that were sent
  with the request
* `cookies_after`: the cookies that were returned in the response
* `success`: `True` or `False` indicating whether the request was successful

Similarly, you can also control what is returned when the request is
successful by setting `on_success` to a value.  If you set
`on_success` to `True`, then `True` will be returned if the request
was successful.

There are three special values of `on_success` that you might want to
use:
* if you set `on_success` to `text`, then the UTF-8-decoded text
  response is returned.  You may want to use this if you don't want
  **docassemble** to attempt to convert the response to [JSON], and
  you just want the plain text of the response
* if you set `on_success` to `content`, then the raw (not UTF-8
  decoded) response is returned.  You may want to use this if the
  request might return a binary file, such as an image or a PDF file.
  For example, you could download a file by setting
  `on_success=content` and then passing the result to the
  [`write()`](#DAFile.write) method of the `DAFile` class, along with
  `binary=True`.

The `on_success` feature also supports the special `'raise'` result,
in case you want to inspect the output of a successful call.  Although
if you are this interested in inspecting the results of a successful
call, you should probably be writing custom methods that call
[`requests`] directly.

## <a name="DAGoogleAPI"></a>DAGoogleAPI

The `DAGoogleAPI` object provides convenient access to Google's APIs
through a Google [service account] that you set up in the [Google
Developers Console] and enable in the **docassemble** [Configuration].

The `DAGoogleAPI` object can be used with the low-level [Google API]
and also with higher-level API packages like [gspread] or the [Cloud
Translation API Client Library].

The benefit of the `DAGoogleAPI` object is that it streamlines the
process of authenticating to Google's servers.  It also provides a
standard way to keep [service account] authentication information in
the [Configuration].

### <a name="DAGoogleAPI setup"></a>Setup process

In order for your site to communicate with Google, you will need to
create an account on the [Google Developers Console] and create an
"app."  Within this app, you will need to create a [service account].
Then set the [`service account credentials`] directive in the
[Configuration] to the credentials for this [service account].  For
more information on how to do this, see the documentation for the
[`service account credentials`] directive.

Finally, you need to use the [Google Developers Console] to enable the
APIs that you want to use.  For example, if you want to use the
[Google Drive API], you need to explicitly enable the [Google Drive
API] for your app.

### <a name="DAGoogleAPI usage"></a>Usage

Suppose you define `api` to be a `DAGoogleAPI` object:

{% highlight yaml %}
objects:
  - api: DAGoogleAPI
{% endhighlight %}

There are two categories of methods available.  The first is for the
low-level [Google API] available through the
[`google-api-python-client`] package.  This can be used to control any
of the [Google API]s.

* `api.api_credentials(scope)` - this returns a
  [`ServiceAccountCredentials`] object from the
  [oauth2client.service_account] library, initialized for the given `scope`.
* `api.http(scope)` - this returns an [`httplib2.Http()`] object that
  has been modified to send the appropriate credentials to Google.
* `api.drive_service()` - this returns the result
  `apiclient.discovery.build()` with the appropriate parameters for
  the [Google Drive API].

The `scope` can be a single scope like
`'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive'`, or it can be a list of
scopes, like `['https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform',
'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-vision']`.  You can browse
Google's [directory of scopes].

Here is an example of a [Python module] that uses the
`.drive_service()` method of the [`DAGoogleAPI`] object to provide
convenience functions for reading and writing to a [Google Drive]

To use this module, log in to [Google Drive] using a normal Google
account and create a folder.  Then share that folder with the e-mail
address of your [service account].  Then, when you call
`get_folder_names()`, the name of this folder will be part of the list
that is returned.

Here is an interview that uses this module to access a [Google Drive]
folder called "DADemo".  It assumes the module is a file called
`google_drive.py` in the same package as the interview.

{% highlight yaml %}

{% endhighlight %}

You can use any [Google API], not just the [Google Drive API].  The
`.drive_service()` method is provided only as a convenience.  You can
create your own services by running something like:

{% highlight python %}
import apiclient
import docassemble.base.util

api = docassemble.base.util.DAGoogleAPI()
http = api.http('https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-translation')

service = apiclient.discovery.build('translate', 'v2', http=http)
{% endhighlight %}

Note that while the `api` object can safely persist in your users'
[interview session dictionary], a variable like `service` cannot be
[pickled], so if you store it in your interview file, you will get an
error.  Ideally, you should always use Python modules for functions
that access APIs, so that there is no danger of an error if
**docassemble** tries to pickle an object that cannot be pickled.

The second category of methods is for [Google Cloud packages] like
[`google.cloud.storage`] and [`google.cloud.translate`].  If a Google
service is available both through [`google-api-python-client`] and
through one of the [Google Cloud packages], the [Google Cloud
packages] are probably preferable because they are newer and
easier to use.  Most of these packages are not installed in the
**docassemble** system by default and will need to be installed with
"Package Management" if you want to use them.  Whatever package name
Google tells you to use with `pip`, you can type into the "Package on
PyPI" field in "Package Management."

The methods of the [`DAGoogleAPI`] object that can be used with the
[Google Cloud packages] include the following:

* `api.cloud_credentials(scope)` - this returns a
  [`Credentials`] object from the
  [google.oauth2.service_account] module, initialized for the given
  `scope`.
* `api.project_id()` - this returns the ID of the "app" in which the
  [service account] is configured.  This ID, which is just a text
  string, is required by some API methods.
* `google_cloud_storage_client()` - this returns a
  `google.cloud.storage.Client` object that can be used to access the
  [Google Cloud Storage] API.
* `google_cloud_vision_client()` - this returns a
  `google.cloud.vision.ImageAnnotatorClient` object that can be used to access the
  [Google Cloud Vision] API.

Here is an example of a [Python module] that uses the [Google Cloud
Storage] API (the [`google.cloud.storage`] Python package):

{% highlight python %}
import docassemble.base.util

__all__ = ['make_bucket', 'get_bucket', 'make_blob']

api = docassemble.base.util.DAGoogleAPI()
client = api.google_cloud_storage_client()

def make_bucket(bucket_name):
  return client.create_bucket(bucket_name)

def get_bucket(bucket_name):
  return client.get_bucket(bucket_name)

def make_blob(bucket_name, blob_name, blob_content):
  bucket = get_bucket(bucket_name)
  blob = bucket.blob(blob_name)
  blob.upload_from_string(blob_content)
  return blob
{% endhighlight %}

## <a name="DABreadCrumbs"></a>DABreadCrumbs

The `DABreadCrumbs` object facilitates displaying "breadcrumbs" in the
user interface to show the user where they are when the current
[`question`] is the result of an [action] within an [action].

In the following example interview, after reaching the "Thank you for
your answers!" page, the user can launch an action within an action
within an action by doing the following:

1. Click the "edit your answers" link
2. Click "Edit" on one of the table items
3. Click the "types of fruit" link on the page that asks for a
   person's favorite fruit.

When the user enters a nested action like this, a "breadcrumbs"
display may help make clear how the question they are seeing relates
to the original [action] they launched.

{% include side-by-side.html demo="breadcrumbs" %}

A "breadcrumbs" display may be particularly helpful when you have a
[`review`] screen that allows the user to spot-edit answers in a
lengthy interview.  When an interview is long, it is a best practice
to avoid having a very lengthy [`review`] screen and to instead allow
the user to navigate through sub-screens to the field they want to
edit.  For example, clicking an edit button on the main [`review`]
screen could open a subsidiary review screen, on which clicking an
edit button launches a process of editing several variables in
series.  In a scenario like this, the breadcrumbs will help the user
see the path they took from the original review screen.

A `DABreadCrumbs` object does not store any data; it is simply a
mechanism for accessing and displaying the [actions] that are
currently active.  The core method of `DABreadCrumbs` is
`.get_crumbs()`, which returns a Python `list` of breadcrumb names of
the "parent" [`question`]s, followed by the current [`question`].  By
default, the breadcrumb name of a [`question`] is the text indicated
by the `question` specifier.  However, this can be overridden by
attaching a [`breadcrumb` modifier] to the [`question`].  If the
[`question`] the user is seeing is not the result of an [action], then
`.get_crumbs()` returns an empty list.

The `.show()` method returns raw HTML for displaying the breadcrumbs
in [Bootstrap format].  If there are no breadcrumbs to display, the
`.show()` method returns the empty string.

In the above example interview, the breadcrumbs are inserted into the
`pre` [screen part], but you can place them anywhere you want.

Because `DABreadCrumbs` is a Python class, you can use Python to
customize how it works.  Here is code you can copy and paste into your
own module file and then customize as you see fit.

{% highlight python %}
from docassemble.base.util import DABreadCrumbs

__all__ = ['MyBreadCrumbs']

class MyBreadCrumbs(DABreadCrumbs):
    def show(self):
        crumbs = self.get_crumbs()
        if len(crumbs) < 2:
            return ''
        last_indexno = len(crumbs) - 1
        return self.container(self.inner(item['breadcrumb'], indexno == last_indexno) for indexno, item in enumerate(crumbs))
    def container(self, items):
        return '<nav class="da-breadcrumb mt-2" aria-label="' + word('breadcrumb') + '"><ol class="breadcrumb">' + ''.join(items) + '</ol></nav>\n'
    def inner(self, label, active):
        if active:
            return '<li class="da-breadcrumb-item breadcrumb-item">' + label + '</li>'
        else:
            return '<li class="da-breadcrumb-item breadcrumb-item active" aria-current="page">' + label + '</li>'
{% endhighlight %}

# <a name="person classes"></a>Classes for information about people and things

## <a name="Thing"></a>Thing

If `pet_rock` is a `Thing`, it will be an object with one attribute:

* `pet_rock.name` (object of class [`Name`])

If you include `${ pet_rock }` in text, the name of the `Thing` will
be inserted.  **docassemble** will look for a definition of
`pet_rock.name.text`.

If you set the `name` attribute of a `Thing` to text, the
`.name.text` attribute will be set to the text you provided.

## <a name="Event"></a>Event

An `Event` is a type of [`DAObject`] with the following attributes
initialized by default:

* `address`: a [`City`] object
* `location`: a [`LatitudeLongitude`] object

There may be many other attributes you want to use for an `Event`, but
they are up to you to choose.

## <a name="Person"></a>Person

The `Person` class encompasses [`Individual`]s as well as legal persons,
like companies, government agencies, etc.  If you create an object of
type `Person` by doing:

{% highlight yaml %}
objects:
  - opponent: Person
{% endhighlight %}

then you will create an object with the following built-in attributes:

* `opponent.name` (object of class [`Name`])
* `opponent.address` (object of class [`Address`])
* `opponent.location` (object of class [`LatitudeLongitude`])

Referring to a `Person` in the context of a [Mako] template will
return the output of `.name.full()`.

If you set the `name` attribute of a `Person` to text, the
`.name.text` attribute will be set to the text you provided.

The following attributes are also used, but undefined by default:

* `email` (see [`.email_address()`] and [`send_email()`])
* `phone_number` (see [`.sms_number()`] and [`send_sms()`] )
* `mobile_number` (see [`.sms_number()`] and [`send_sms()`])
* `uses_whatsapp` (see [`.sms_number()`] and [`send_sms()`])

The following methods can be used:

### <a name="Person.possessive"></a>`.possessive()`

Calling `defendant.possessive('fish')` returns "ABC Corporation's
fish" or "your fish" depending on whether `defendant` is the user.

### <a name="Person.identified"></a>`.identified()`

Calling `defendant.identified()` returns `True` if `defendant.name.text`
has been defined.  The
[version for `Individual`s](#Individual.identified)
is different.

### <a name="Person.pronoun_objective"></a>`.pronoun_objective()`

Calling `defendant.pronoun_objective()` returns "it," while calling
`defendant.pronoun_objective(capitalize=True)` returns "It."

### <a name="Person.object_possessive"></a>`.object_possessive()`

Calling `defendant.object_possessive('fish')` returns "defendant's
fish."

### <a name="Person.is_are_you"></a>`.is_are_you()`

Calling `defendant.is_are_you()` returns "are you" if `defendant` is
the user, and otherwise returns "is defendant."  Calling
`defendant.is_are_you(capitalize=True)` returns "Are you" or "Is
defendant."

### <a name="Person.is_user"></a>`.is_user()`

Calling `defendant.is_user()` returns `True` if the `defendant` is the
user, and otherwise returns `False`.

### <a name="Person.address_block"></a>`.address_block()`

Calling `defendant.address_block()` will return the name followed by
the address, in a format suitable for inclusion in a document.  For example:

{% highlight text %}
[FLUSHLEFT] ABC Corporation [NEWLINE] 1500 Market Street [NEWLINE] Philadelphia, PA 19102
{% endhighlight %}

See [markup] for more information about how this will appear in documents.

### <a name="Person.do_question"></a>`.do_question()`

Calling `defendant.do_question('testify')` returns "do you testify" if
the defendant is the user, or otherwise it uses the defendant's name,
as in "does ABC Corporation testify."

### <a name="Person.did_question"></a>`.did_question()`

Calling `defendant.did_question('testify')` returns "did you testify" if
the defendant is the user, or otherwise it uses the defendant's name,
as in "did ABC Corporation testify."

### <a name="Person.were_question"></a>`.were_question()`

Calling `defendant.were_question('guilty')` returns "were you guilty" if
the defendant is the user, or otherwise it uses the defendant's name,
as in "was ABC Corporation guilty."

### <a name="Person.have_question"></a>`.have_question()`

Calling `defendant.have_question('lied')` returns "have you lied" if
the defendant is the user, or otherwise it uses the defendant's name,
as in "has ABC Corporation lied."

### <a name="Person.does_verb"></a>`.does_verb()`

Calling `defendant.does_verb('testify')` returns "testify" if the
defendant is the user, but otherwise returns "testifies."  The method
accepts the optional keyword arguments `present` and `past`, which are
expected to be set to `True` or `False`.  For example,
`defendant.does_verb('testify', past=True)` will return "testified."

### <a name="Person.did_verb"></a>`.did_verb()`

The `.did_verb()` method is like the
[`.does_verb()`](#Person.does_verb) method, except that it conjugates
the verb into the past tense.

### <a name="Person.subject"></a>`.subject()`

The `.subject()` method returns "you" if the person is the user, but
otherwise returns the person's name.

### <a name="Person.email_address"></a>`.email_address()`

Calling `defendant.email_address()` will return the person's name
followed by the person's e-mail address, in the standard e-mail
format.  E.g., `'ABC Corporation <info@abc.com>'`.  If the name is not
yet defined, the e-mail address by itself (`info@abc.com`) will be
returned.

If you want to force **docassemble** to ask for the recipient's name,
set the optional keyword parameter `include_name` to `True`.

You can suppress the inclusion of the person's name by setting
`include_name` to `False`.

### <a name="Person.sms_number"></a>`.sms_number()`

Calling `defendant.sms_number()` will return `defendant.mobile_number`
if the `.mobile_number` attribute exists; it will not cause
the question to be asked.  If the `.mobile_number` attribute does not
exist, it will use `defendant.phone_number`.

The method formats the phone number in [E.164] format.  The method
accepts an optional keyword parameter `country`, which will be used to
format the phone number, since the [E.164] format contains the
international [country calling code] of the phone number.  If a
`country` is not provided, `defendant.country` is used, If the
`.country` attribute is not defined, `.address.country` will be tried,
but if that is not defined either, the method will call
[`get_country()`].  The country is expected to be a two-letter,
capitalized abbreviation of a country ([ISO 3166-1 alpha-2] format).

If a `mobile_number` attribute exists and a `uses_whatsapp` number
also exists and is `True`, then [WhatsApp] will be used to send messages
to the number.

### <a name="Organization"></a>Organization

An `Organization` is a subclass of [`Person`].  It has the attribute
`.office`, which is an object of type [`OfficeList`].

It uses the following attributes, which by default are not defined:

* `handles`: refers to a list of problems the organization handles.
* `serves`: refers to a list of counties the organization serves.

<a name="Organization.will_handle"></a>The `.will_handle()` method
returns `True` or `False` depending on whether the organization serves
a given county or handles a given problem.  It takes two optional
keyword arguments: `problem` and `county`.  For example, you could
call `agency.will_handle(problem='Divorce', county='Hampshire County')`.

### <a name="Individual"></a>Individual

The `Individual` is a subclass of [`Person`].  This class should be used
for persons who you know are human beings.

If you create an object of type `Individual` by doing:

{% highlight yaml %}
objects:
  - president: Individual
{% endhighlight %}

then you will create an object with the following built-in attribute:

* `president.name` (object of class [`IndividualName`])

In addition, the following attributes will be defined by virtue of an
`Individual` being a kind of [`Person`]:

* `president.address` (object of class [`Address`])
* `president.location` (object of class [`LatitudeLongitude`])

The following attributes are also used, but undefined by default:

* <a name="Individual.age"></a>`age` - this can be set to a number.
  It is used by the [`age_in_years()`] method.
* <a name="Individual.birthdate"></a>`birthdate` - this can be the
  result of a [date field], or a [`datetime`] object.  It is used by
  the [`age_in_years()`] method if the [`age`] attribute has not been
  defined.
* <a name="Individual.gender"></a>`gender` - this should be set to
  `'male'`, `'female'`, or `'other'`.  It is used by a variety of
  methods such as [`pronoun()`].
* <a name="Individual.use_familiar"></a>`use_familiar` - set this to
  `True` if you want the individual to be referred to by their first
  name when the individual's name is reduced to text.  By default, the
  full name is used.

<a name="set_info"></a>A number of useful methods can be applied to
objects of class `Individual`.  Many of them will respond differently
depending on whether the `Individual` is the user or not.  If you use
these methods, be sure to inform **docassemble** who the user is by
inserting the following [initial block]:

{% highlight yaml %}
initial: True
code: |
  set_info(user=client)
{% endhighlight %}

(If you include the [`basic-questions.yml`] file, this is done for
you.) See the documentation for the [`set_info()`] function for more
information.

### <a name="Individual.identified"></a>`.identified()`

Returns `True` if the individual's name has been defined yet,
otherwise it returns `False`.

### <a name="Individual.age_in_years"></a>`.age_in_years()`

`user.age_in_years()` returns the `user`'s age in years as a whole
number.

There are two optional arguments that modify the method's behavior:

* `user.age_in_years(decimals=True)` returns the user's age in years
  with the fractional part included.
* `user.age_in_years(as_of="5/1/2015")` returns the user's age as of a
  particular date.

To determine the user's age, this method first looks to see if there
is an attribute [`age`].  If there is, the value of this attribute is
returned.  However, the `age_in_years()` method will not cause the
interview to seek out this attribute.

If the [`age`] attribute is not defined, this method will calculate
the individual's age based on the [`birthdate`] attribute, which will
be interpreted as a date.  The [`birthdate`] attribute can be a date
expressed in text, as it would be if it was defined by a [date field],
or it can be a [`datetime`] object.

### <a name="Individual.age_in_months"></a>`.age_in_months()`

The `age_in_months()` method is like `age_in_years()`, except the
`age` attribute is not considered, and the result is a number of
months instead of a number of years.

### <a name="Individual.first_name_hint"></a><a name="Individual.last_name_hint"></a>`.first_name_hint()` and `.last_name_hint()`

When you are writing questions in an interview, you may find yourself
in this position:

* You are asking for the name of a person;
* That person whose name you need may be the user;
* The user may be logged in;
* The user, if logged in, may have already provided his or her name on
the user profile page; and
* It would be repetitive for the user to retype his or her
name.

In this situation, it would be convenient for the user if the user's
name was auto-filled on the page.  The `.first_name_hint()` and
`.last_name_hint()` methods accomplish this for you.  You can ask for
an individual's name as follows:

{% highlight yaml %}
generic object: Individual
question: |
  What is ${ x.object_possessive('name') }?
fields:
  - First Name: x.name.first
    default: ${ x.first_name_hint() }
  - Middle Name: x.name.middle
    required: False
  - Last Name: x.name.last
    default: ${ x.last_name_hint() }
  - Suffix: x.name.suffix
    required: False
    code: |
      name_suffix()
{% endhighlight %}

For an explanation of how [`.object_possessive()`] works, see the
[`Person`] class.

### <a name="Individual.possessive"></a>`.possessive()`

If `client` is an `Individual` and the individual's name is "Adam
Smith," `client.possessive('orange')` returns "Adam Smith's orange."
But if the individual is the current user, this returns "your."  (See
the [note above].)

### <a name="Individual.salutation"></a>`.salutation()`

Depending on the `gender` attribute (one of "male" or "female"),
the `.salutation()` method returns "Mr." or "Ms." This can be helpful
when writing letters. If `gender` is not one of "male" or "female"
the individual's full name is returned.

{% include side-by-side.html demo="salutation" %}

The function takes some optional keyword arguments:

* `client.salutation()` returns `Mr.`
* `client.salutation(with_name=True)` returns `Mr. Jones`
* `client.salutation(with_name_and_punctuation=True)` returns `Mr. Jones:`

This function relies on a few attributes, which it looks for but does
not assume exist:

* <a name="Individual.salutation_to_use"></a>If `.salutation_to_use`
  is set, `.salutation()` uses its value as the salutation instead of
  `'Mr.'` or `'Ms.'`.
* <a name="Individual.is_doctor"></a>If `.is_doctor` is set to a true
  value, the salutation "Dr." is used.
* <a name="Individual.is_judge"></a>If `.is_judge` is set to a true
  value, the salutation "Judge" is used.
* If `.name.suffix` is `'MD'` or `'PhD'`, the salutation "Dr." is used.
* If `.name.suffix` is `'J'`, the salutation "Judge" is used.
* <a name="Individual.is_friendly"></a>If `.is_friendly` is set to a
  true value, a comma will be used in place of a colon when
  `with_name_and_punctuation` is true.

The operation of this function can be customized with
[`docassemble.base.util.update_language_function()`].  Use the
function name `'salutation'` and provide a function that takes an
object of class [`Individual`] as an argument.  For reference, here is
the default function (from [`docassemble.base.functions`]):

{% highlight python %}
def salutation_default(indiv, with_name=False, with_name_and_punctuation=False):
    """Returns Mr., Ms., etc. for an individual."""
    used_gender = False

If you wanted a simpler function, you could include something like

    else:

### <a name="Individual.pronoun_possessive"></a>`.pronoun_possessive()`

If the individual is `client`, then
`client.pronoun_possessive('fish')` returns "your fish," "his fish,"
"her fish," or "their fish" depending on whether `client` is the user (see the
[note above]) and depending on the value of `client.gender`.
`client.pronoun_possessive('fish', capitalize=True)` returns "Your
fish," "His fish," "Her fish," or "Their fish."

If you want to refer to the individual in the third person even if the
individual is the user, write `client.pronoun_possessive('fish',
third_person=True)`.

For portability to different languages, this method requires you to
provide the noun you are modifying.  In some languages, the possessive
pronoun may be different depending on what the noun is.

### <a name="Individual.pronoun"></a>`.pronoun()`

Returns "you," "him," "her," or "them," depending on whether the individual is
the user (see the [note above]) and depending on the value of the
`gender` attribute.  If called with `capitalize=True`, the word will
be capitalized (for use at the beginning of a sentence).

### <a name="Individual.pronoun_objective"></a>`.pronoun_objective()`

For the `Individual` class, `pronoun_objective()` does the same thing
as `pronoun`.  (Other classes returns "it.")  If called with
`capitalize=True`, the output will be capitalized.

### <a name="Individual.pronoun_subjective"></a>`.pronoun_subjective()`

Returns "you," "he," "she," or "they," depending on whether the individual is
the user (see the [note above]) and depending on the value of the
`gender` attribute.

You can call this method with the following optional keyword arguments:

* `third_person=True`: will use "he" or "she" even if the individual
is the user.
* `capitalize=True`: the output will be capitalized (for use at the
  beginning of a sentence)

### <a name="Individual.yourself_or_name"></a>`.yourself_or_name()`

Returns "yourself" if the individual is the user (see the [note
above]), but otherwise returns the person's name.  If called with the
optional keyword argument `capitalize=True`, the output will be
capitalized.

## <a name="Name"></a>Name

The `Name` is the base class for names of things, such as [`Person`].
For example, if `plaintiff` is a [`Person`], `plaintiff.name` is an
object of type `Name`.  If `plaintiff` is an [`Individual`],
`plaintiff.name` is an object of type [`IndividualName`], which is a
subtype of `Name`.  (The [`IndividualName`] is defined in the next
section.)

Objects of the basic [`Name`] class have just one attribute, `text`.
To set the name of a [`Person`] called `company`, for example, you can
do something like this:

{% include side-by-side.html demo="name-company-question" %}

There are multiple ways to refer to the name of an object, but the
best way is to write something like this:

{% include side-by-side.html demo="name-company" %}

Multiple ways of referring to the name of a [`Person`] are illustrated
in the following interview:

{% include side-by-side.html demo="name" %}

Note that `${ opponent.name.full() }`, `${ opponent.name }`, and `${
opponent }` all return the same thing.  This is because a [`Person`]
in the context of a [Mako] template returns `.name.full()`, and a
[`Name`] returns `.full()`.

The reason a name is not just a piece of text, but rather an object
with attributes like `text` and methods like `.full()`, is that some
objects have names with multiple parts that you will want to express
in multiple ways.  You might have a list of parties in a case, where
the parties can be companies or individuals.  It helps to have a
common way of referring to the names of these objects.

<a name="Name.full"></a>
<a name="Name.firstlast"></a>
<a name="Name.lastfirst"></a>
<a name="Name.middle_initial"></a>
<a name="Name.familiar"></a>
The [`Name`] and [`IndividualName`] objects support the following methods:

* `.full()` - e.g., "John E. Smith, Jr."
* `.firstlast()` - e.g., "John Smith, Jr."
* `.lastfirst()` - e.g., "Smith, John Jr."
* `.middle_initial()` - e.g., "E."
* `.middle_initial(with_period=False)` - e.g., "E"
* `.familiar()` - e.g., "John"

Applied to an [`IndividualName`] object, these methods return
different useful expressions of the name.  Applied to a [`Name`]
object, these methods all return the same thing -- the `.text`
attribute (except for `middle_initial()`, which returns the empty
string).  This is useful because you can write things like this, which
lists the names of the parties in a bullet-point list:

{% include side-by-side.html demo="lastfirst" %}

In this template, the developer does not need to worry about which
parties are companies and which parties are individuals; the name will
be listed in the bullet-point list in an appropriate way.  For
individuals, the last name will come first, but for non-individuals,
the regular name will be printed.

<a name="Name.defined"></a>
The [`Name`] and [`IndividualName`] objects also support the method:

* `.defined()`

This returns `True` if the necessary component of the name (`.text`
for a [`Name`], `first` for an [`IndividualName`]) has been defined yet.
Otherwise it returns `False`.

### <a name="IndividualName"></a>IndividualName

The [`Individual`] class is a subclass of [`Person`].  It defines the
`name` attribute as an `IndividualName` rather than a [`Name`].  An
`IndividualName` uses the following attributes, which are expected to
be text:

* `first`
* `middle`
* `last`
* `suffix`

In the context of a [Mako] template, a reference to an `IndividualName` on
its own will return `.full()`.

The `full()` method attempts to form a full name from these
components.  Only `first` is required, however.  This means that if
you refer to an `IndividualName` in a [Mako] template, e.g., by
writing `${ applicant.name }`, **docassemble** will attempt to return
`applicant.name.full()`, and if `applicant.name.first` has not been
defined yet, **docassemble** will look for a question that defines
`applicant.name.first`.

Here is how `full()` and other methods of the `IndividualName` work:

* <a name="IndividualName.full"></a>`applicant.full()`: "John Q. Adams"
* `applicant.full(middle="full")`: "John Quincy Adams"
* <a name="IndividualName.firstlast"></a>`applicant.firstlast()`: "John Adams"
* <a name="IndividualName.lastfirst"></a>`applicant.lastfirst()`: "Adams, John"
* <a name="IndividualName.defined"></a>`applicant.defined()`: Returns
  `True` if the `.first` attribute has been defined yet.

The `IndividualName` also uses the attribute `.uses_parts`, which is
`True` by default.  If `.uses_parts` is set to `False`, then the
methods of the object fall back on the methods of [`Name`], and the
individual's name is stored in the attribute `.text`.

If you set the `name` attribute of an `Individual` to text, the
`.uses_parts` attribute will be set to `False` and `.name.text` will
be set to the text you provided.

## <a name="Address"></a>Address

An `Address` has the following text attributes:

* `address`: e.g., "123 Main Street"
* `unit`: e.g., "Suite 100"
* `city`: e.g., "Springfield"
* `state`: e.g., "MA"
* `zip`: e.g. "01199"
* `country`: e.g., 'US' ([ISO 3166-1 alpha-2] format)
* `city_only`: defaults to `False`.  See [`City`], below.

Instead of `zip`, you can use `postal_code`.

It also has an attribute `location`, which is a [`LatitudeLongitude`]
object representing the GPS coordinates of the address.

If you refer to an address in a [Mako] template, it returns `.block()`.

<a name="Address.block"></a> The `.block()` method returns a formatted
address.  At a minimum, the attribute `city` is required.

{% include side-by-side.html demo="address-block" %}

The optional keyword argument `language` will affect
the translation of the word "Unit" if the address contains a suite
number like `'2000'`.  (See the
[`.formatted_unit()`](#Address.formatted_unit) method.)

The optional keyword argument `show_country` can be set to `True` if
you always want the country to be shown.  Set it to `False` if you
never want the country to be shown.  The default value is `None`,
which means the country is shown only if the `.country` attribute of
the address differs from the default country.

The optional keyword argument `international` can be set to `True` if
you want the address to be formatted according to [Google's
internationalization standards].

<a name="Address.formatted_unit"></a> The `.formatted_unit()` method
returns the `.unit` attribute (or the `.floor` or `.room`) attributes,
formatted appropriately.  For example, if the `unit` attribute is
`'2000'`, this will return `'Unit 2000'`.  But if the `unit` attribute
is `'Suite 2000'`, this method will return `'Suite 2000'`.  By
default, if the `.unit` attribute is not defined, this method will
return `''`.  However, if it is called as
`.formatted_unit(require=True)` and neither `.unit` nor `.floor` nor
`.room` is defined, it will seek the definition of the `unit`
attribute.  It takes an optional keyword argument `language`, which
will affect the translation of the word "Unit."

<a name="Address.geocode"></a><a name="Address.geolocate"></a> The
`.geocode()` method determines the latitude and longitude of the
address and stores it in the attribute `location`, which is a
[`LatitudeLongitude`] object.  It uses the
[`geopy.geocoders.GoogleV3`] class.  To use this, you will need an API
key for the [Google Maps Geocoding API], which you will need to add to
the [configuration] as the [`api key`] subdirective under the
[`google`] directive.

In previous versions of **docassemble**, this method was called
`.geolocate()`.  The `.geolocate()` method and its associated
attributes (`.geolocated`, `.geolocate_success`,
`.geolocate_response`) will continue to function until the next minor
version update.

The following methods are available to query the status of geocoding:

* `myaddress.was_geocoded()`: this will return `True` if the geocoding
  process has been performed (whether it was successful or not).  If
  `myaddress.was_geocoded()` returns `True`, then calling
  `.geocode()` again will not call the API again; rather, it will
  immediately return with whatever result was obtained the first time
  `.geocode()` was called.  In previous versions of **docassemble**,
  the attribute `myaddress.geocoded` was used instead of this method.
* `myaddress.was_geocoded_successfully()`: if `.geocode()` was able to
  successfully call the API and get a result, this will return `True`;
  otherwise, this will return `False`.  In previous versions of
  **docassemble**, the attribute `myaddress.geocode_success` was used
  for this purpose.
* `myaddress.get_geocode_response()`: if `.geocode()` was able to
  successfully call the API and get a result, this will return the raw
  results returned from the [Google Maps Geocoding API].  In previous
  versions of **docassemble**, the attribute
  `myaddress.geocode_response` was used for this purpose.

If you call `.geocode()` on an [`Address`] object called
`myaddress`, the following attributes will be set:

* `myaddress.location.gathered`: if `.geocode()` was able to
  successfully call the API and get a result, this will be set to `True`.
* `myaddress.location.known`: if `.geocode()` was able to
  successfully call the API and get a result, this will be set to
  `True`.
* `myaddress.location.latitude`: if `.geocode()` was able to
  successfully call the API and get a result, this will be set to the
  latitude of the address.
* `myaddress.location.longitude`: if `.geocode()` was able to
  successfully call the API and get a result, this will be set to the
  latitude of the address.
* `myaddress.location.description`: if `.geocode()` was able to
  successfully call the API and get a result, this will be set to the
  value of `myaddress.block()`.
* `myaddress.one_line`: if `.geocode()` was able to
  successfully call the API and get a result, this will be set to the
  address as the geocoder would format it to be expressed on one
  line.
* `myaddress.norm`: if `.geocode()` was able to successfully call
  the API and get a result, this will be set to an [`Address`] object
  containing normalized names of the address components.
* `myaddress.norm_long`: if `.geocode()` was able to successfully
  call the API and get a result, this will be set to an [`Address`]
  object containing long-form normalized names of the address
  components.  (E.g., "1234 Main Street" instead of "1234 Main St" and
  "California" instead of "CA.")

In addition, the following attributes will be set if the attribute was
not already set, and if `.geocode()` was able to successfully
determine the value by calling the API:

* `myaddress.street_number` - the street number (e.g., `123`).
* `myaddress.street` - the street name (e.g., `Main St`).
* `myaddress.city` - the city (known as (`locality`).
* `myaddress.county` - the county (known as `administrative_area_level_2`).
* `myaddress.state` - the state (known as `administrative_area_level_1`).
* `myaddress.zip` - the Zip code (known as `postal_code`).
* `myaddress.country` - the country (e.g., `US`) in [ISO 3166-1 alpha-2] format.

In addition, the following attributes will be set to the "long" form
of the values returned from the [Google Maps Geocoding API], if applicable:

* `myaddress.administrative_area_level_1`
* `myaddress.administrative_area_level_2`
* `myaddress.administrative_area_level_3`
* `myaddress.administrative_area_level_4`
* `myaddress.administrative_area_level_5`
* `myaddress.colloquial_area`
* `myaddress.floor`
* `myaddress.intersection`
* `myaddress.locality`
* `myaddress.neighborhood`
* `myaddress.post_box`
* `myaddress.postal_code`
* `myaddress.postal_code_prefix`
* `myaddress.postal_code_suffix`
* `myaddress.postal_town`
* `myaddress.premise`
* `myaddress.room`
* `myaddress.route`
* `myaddress.sublocality`
* `myaddress.sublocality_level_1`
* `myaddress.sublocality_level_2`
* `myaddress.sublocality_level_3`
* `myaddress.sublocality_level_4`
* `myaddress.sublocality_level_5`
* `myaddress.subpremise`

Here is an example that illustrates how the `.geocode()` method works:

{% include side-by-side.html demo="geocode" %}

There is a also a second use of the `geocode()` method, which is to
populate the attributes of an empty `Address` object using an address
expressed as one line of text:

{% include side-by-side.html demo="geocode-from-address" %}

If this is used on an `Address` that already has populated attributes,
the attributes of the existing address will be overwritten.

Normally, calling `geocode()` on an object (without an `address`
parameter) after geocoding has been performed has no effect.  This
allows you to safely insert a call to `geocode()` in your interview
logic without running up a large bill for your [Google API] usage.
However, if you call `geocode(reset=True)`, the old geocoding
information will be deleted and the geocoding will be performed
again.  If your interview allows the user to edit an address after it
has been geocoded, you will want to make sure that your interview
logic will re-run the geocoding after the address is edited.  The
`reset=True` parameter can help you ensure that this geocoding is
redone.

{% include side-by-side.html demo="geocode-reset" %}

You can also use the [`.reset_geocoding()`] method to delete the
geocoding information.

<a name="Address.normalize"></a>
The `.normalize()` method uses the results of `.geocode()` to
standardize the formatting of the parts of the address.  This will
overwrite the attributes of the object.  This method takes an optional
keyword parameter `long_format`, which defaults to `False`.  If this
parameter is `True`, the address will be normalized using the long
form of the normalization.  (E.g., "California" instead of "CA.")

{% include side-by-side.html demo="normalize" %}

Note that if you want to access a normalized version of the address,
but you don't want to overwrite the original attributes of the object,
you can simply run `.geocode()` and then, if it is successful,
access the `.norm` attribute or the `.norm_long` attribute, both of
which will be fully populated [`Address`] objects, with normalized
attributes.

<a name="Address.reset_geocoding"></a><a name="Address.reset_geolocation"></a>
If you need to redo the geocoding after the original address is
edited, you can call `.reset_geocoding()` on the `Address` object
and all of the geocoding information will be deleted.  This has the
same effect as calling `geocode()` with `reset=True`.

This method was previously called `.reset_geolocation()`.  The old
name still works but will be removed in the next minor version.

<a name="Address.line_one"></a>
The `.line_one()` method returns the first line of the address,
including the unit, if the unit is defined.

<a name="Address.line_two"></a>
The `.line_two()` method returns the second line of the address,
consisting of the city, state, and zip code.

<a name="Address.on_one_line"></a>
The `.on_one_line()` method returns the address, consisting of
the city, state, and zip code, as a single line of text.

It takes two optional keyword parameters:

* `include_unit` - Default value is `True`.  Set to `False` if you
  don't want the unit number to be included.
* `show_country` - Default value is `None`.  Set to `True` if you
  always want the country to be shown.  Set to `False` if you never
  want the country to be shown.  Set to `None` if you want the country
  to be shown only if the `.country` differs from the default country.

### <a name="address autocomplete"></a>Address autocomplete

If you have defined a [`google maps api key`] in the [Configuration],
you can use the [Place Autocomplete] feature of the [Google Places
API] to help your users enter addresses.  Address suggestions will be
provided as the user begins to type.  To use this feature, modify the
street address (`.address`) field by setting `address autocomplete` to
`True`.  Then, when the user selects an address, the other components
of the address will be filled in with the values obtained from Google.
This will only work if the address components are part of the same
`Address` object.  For example, if the street address field is
`client.address.address`, the other fields must be called
`client.address.city`, `client.address.state`, etc.  You do not need
to include all of these attributes; any attributes not included in the
front end of the page will be ignored.

For this feature to work, your [`google maps api key`] will need to be
associated with an app for which the following APIs are enabled:

* Places API (New)
* Maps JavaScript API

Here is an example that illustrates how the address autocomplete
feature works:

{% include side-by-side.html demo="address-autocomplete" %}

### <a name="City"></a>City

A `City` is a type of `Address` for which the attribute `.city_only`
is set to `True`.  Functions that display the address will only
display the city, the state, and (if set) the zip code.

## <a name="LatitudeLongitude"></a>LatitudeLongitude

A `LatitudeLongitude` object represents the GPS coordinates of an
address or location.  `LatitudeLongitude` objects have the following
attributes:

* `latitude`: the latitude of the location.
* `longitude`: the longitude of the location.
* `description`: a textual description of the location.
* `known`: whether the GPS location is known yet.
* `gathered`: whether a determination of the GPS location has been
attempted yet.

One use for the `LatitudeLongitude` object is for mapping the
coordinates of an address.  The [`Address`] object has a method
`.geocode()` for this purpose.

<a name="LatitudeLongitude.status"></a>
Another use for the `LatitudeLongitude` object is storing the GPS
location of the user's device.  Many web browsers, particularly those
on mobile devices, have a feature for determining the user's GPS
coordinates.  Usually the browser asks the user to consent to the
sharing of the location information.  To support this feature, the
`LatitudeLongitude` object offers the method `.status()`.

The following example shows how to gather the user's latitude and
longitude from the web browser.

{% highlight yaml %}
include:
  - basic-questions.yml
---
initial: True
code: |
  track_location = user.location.status()
{% endhighlight %}

Alternatively, if you do not want to include all of the questions and
code blocks of the [`basic-questions.yml`] file in your interview, you
can do:

{% highlight yaml %}
objects:
  - user: Individual
---
initial: True
code: |
  set_info(user=user, role='user_role')
  track_location = user.location.status()
{% endhighlight %}

If all goes well, the user's latitude and longitude will be gathered
and stored in `user.location.latitude` and `user.location.longitude`.
You can control when this happens in the interview by controlling when
`track_location` is set.  For example, you may wish to prepare the
user for this:

{% highlight yaml %}
initial: True
code: |
  set_info(user=user, role='user_role')
  if user_ok_with_sharing_location:
    track_location = user.location.status()
---
question: |
  We would like to gather information about your current location
  from your mobile device.  Is that ok with you?
yesno: user_ok_with_sharing_location
{% endhighlight %}

[`track_location`] is a [special variable] that tells **docassemble**
whether or not it should ask the browser for the user's GPS
coordinates the next time a question is posed to the user.  If
[`track_location`] is `True`, **docassemble** will ask the browser to
provide the information, and if it receives it, it will make it
available for retrieval through the [`user_lat_lon()`] function.

The `.status()` method looks to see if a latitude and longitude were
provided by the browser, or in the alternative that an error message
was provided, such as "the user refused to share the information," or
"this device cannot determine the user's location."  If the latitude
and longitude information is conveyed, `.status()` stores the
information in `user.location.latitude` and `user.location.longitude`.
The `.status()` method returns `False` in these situations, which
means "we already asked for the latitude and longitude and got a
response, so there is no longer any need for the browser to keep
asking for it."  Otherwise, it returns `True`, which means "the
browser has not yet been asked for the location information, so let's
ask it."

# <a name="currencyclasses"></a>Classes for currency

## <a name="Value"></a>Value

A `Value` is a subclass of [`DAObject`] that is intended to represent a
currency value that may or may not need to be asked for in an interview.

For example, suppose you want to have a variable that represents the
value of the user's real estate holdings.  But before you ask the
value of the user's real estate holdings, you will want to ask if the
user has real estate holdings at all.

A `Value` has two attributes, both of which are initially undefined:

* `.value`: intended to be a number
* `.exists`: a boolean value representing whether the value is applicable

The `.exists` attribute facilitates asking questions about values
using two screens: first, ask whether the value exists at all, then
ask for the value.  For example:

{% include side-by-side.html demo="exists" %}

The [`FinancialList`] object, explained below, represents a list of
`Value`s.  When computing a total of the values (with `.total()`), it
checks the `.exists` attributes of each `Value` to be defined.  This
causes questions to be asked about whether the `Value` is applicable
to the user's situation before the value itself is requested.

<a name="Value.amount"></a>To access the value of a `Value` object,
you can use the `.amount()` method.  If the `.exists` attribute is
`False`, it will return zero without asking for the `.value`.

Referring to a `Value` in a [Mako] template will show the `.amount()`.  The
value of `.amount()` is also returned when you pass a `Value` to the
[`currency()`] function.  For example:

{% highlight yaml %}
question: |
  The value of your real estate holdings is
  ${ currency(real_estate_holdings) }.

  An identical way of writing this number is
  ${ currency(real_estate_holdings.amount()) }.
{% endhighlight %}

### <a name="PeriodicValue"></a>PeriodicValue

A `PeriodicValue` is a [`Value`] that has an additional attribute,
`period`, which is a number representing the number of times per year
the value applies.

{% include side-by-side.html demo="periodic-value" %}

<a name="PeriodicValue.amount"></a>To access the value of a
`PeriodicValue` object, you can use the `.amount()` method.  If the
`.exists` attribute is `False`, it will return zero without asking for
the `.value`.  By default, it returns the value for the period 1
(e.g., in the example above, period of 1 represents a year).  That is,
it will return the `.value` multiplied by the `.period`.

Referring to a `PeriodicValue` in a [Mako] template will show the
`.amount()`.  The value of `.amount()` is also returned when you pass
a `PeriodicValue` to the [`currency()`] function.

# <a name="listclasses"></a>Classes for lists of things

## <a name="PartyList"></a>PartyList

This is a subclass of [`DAList`].

It is indended to contain a list of [`Person`]s (or [`Individual`]s,
which are a type of [`Person`]) who are parties to a case.

## <a name="ChildList"></a>ChildList

This is a subclass of [`DAList`].

It is indended to contain a list of [`Individual`]s who are children.

## <a name="FinancialList"></a>FinancialList

The `FinancialList` is intended to collect a set of financial items,
such as an individual's assets.  It is a [`DADict`] object with an
[`object_type`] of [`Value`].  The `exists` attribute of each
[`Value`] item is set by default to `True`.

The `FinancialList` has three methods:

* <a name="FinancialList.total"></a>`.total()`: tallies up the total
  value of all `Value`s in the list for which the `exists` attribute
  is `True`.  A reference to `.total()` will cause **docassemble** to
  ask the questions necessary to gather the full list of items.
* <a name="FinancialList.existing_items"></a>`.existing_items()`:
  returns a list of types of amounts that exist within the financial
  list.

In the context of a [Mako] template, a `FinancialList` returns the result of
`.total()`.

### <a name="Asset"></a>Asset

This is a subclass of [`FinancialList`] that is intended to be used to
track assets.

Here is some example code that triggers questions that ask about asset
items.

{% include side-by-side.html demo="assets" %}

## <a name="PeriodicFinancialList"></a>PeriodicFinancialList

This is a subclass of [`FinancialList`] intended to collect a set of
financial items that have a periodic nature, such as an individual's
income.  Instead of each item being a [`Value`], each item is a
[`PeriodicValue`].

The `PeriodicFinancialList` has the following method:

* <a name="PeriodicFinancialList.total"></a>`.total()`: tallies up the
  total annual value of all [`PeriodicValue`]s in the list for which the
  `exists` attribute is `True`.

If you have a `PeriodicFinancialList` called `income`, you can have a
single question that asks for the item name for a new item, and also
the value and period of the new item.  Just write a question that sets
these three attributes:

* `income.new_item_name`
* `income.new_item_value`
* `income.new_item_period`

In the context of a [Mako] template, a `PeriodicFinancialList` returns `.total()`.

### <a name="Income"></a>Income

This is a subclass of [`PeriodicFinancialList`] with no special
properties except the name.

### <a name="Expense"></a>Expense

`Expense` is a [`PeriodicFinancialList`] representing a person's
expenses.  It has no special properties except the name.

## <a name="OfficeList"></a>OfficeList

An `OfficeList` object is a type of [`DAList`], the items of which are
expected to be [`Address`] objects.  It is used in [`Organization`]
objects.

# <a name="specialclasses"></a>Classes for special purposes

## <a name="RoleChangeTracker"></a>RoleChangeTracker

The `RoleChangeTracker` class is provided to facilitate [multi-user
interviews] with **docassemble**'s [roles] system.  It facilitates
sending e-mails to the participants to let them know when the
interview needs their attention.  It keeps track of when these e-mails
have been sent to make sure that duplicative e-mails are not sent.

It has one method:

* <a name="RoleChangeTracker.send_email"></a>`role_change.send_email()`
  (not to be confused with the `send_email()` function)

Here is an example that demonstrates its use:

{% highlight yaml %}
objects:
  - client: Individual
  - advocate: Individual
  - role_change: RoleChangeTracker
---
default role: client
code: |
  if user_logged_in() and \
      advocate.attribute_defined('email') and \
      advocate.email == user_info().email:
    user = advocate
    role = 'advocate'
  else:
    user = client
    role = 'client'
  set_info(user=user, role=role)
---
event: role_event
question: You are done for now.
subquestion: |
  % if 'advocate' in role_needed:
  An advocate needs to review your answers before you can proceed.

  Please remember the following link and come back to it when you
  receive notice to do so:

  [${ interview_url() }](${ interview_url() })
  % else:
  Thanks, the client needs to resume the interview now.
  % endif

  % if role_change.send_email(role_needed, advocate={'to': advocate, 'email': role_event_email_to_advocate}, client={'to': client, 'email': role_event_email_to_client}):
  An e-mail has been sent.
  % endif
decoration: exit
buttons:
  - Exit: leave
---
template: role_event_email_to_advocate
subject: |
  Client interview waiting for your attention: ${ client }
content: |
  A client, ${ client }, has partly finished an interview.

  Please go to [the interview](${ interview_url() }) as soon as
  possible to review the client's answers.
---
template: role_event_email_to_client
subject: |
  Your interview answers have been reviewed
content: |
  An advocate has finished reviewing your answers.

  Please go to [${ interview_url() }](${ interview_url() })
  to resume the interview.
{% endhighlight %}

The `send_email()` method's first argument is the special variable
`role_needed`, a [Python list] that **docassemble** defines internally
whenever there is a mismatch between the current user's role and the
role required by a question that needs to be asked.

The remaining arguments to `send_email()` are [keyword arguments],
where each keyword is the name of a possible role.  Each
[keyword argument] must be a [Python dictionary] containing the
following keys:

* `to`: this needs to be a [`Person`] (or a subclass, like
[`Individual`]).  The person's `email` attribute is expected to be
defined.
* `email`: this needs to a [`DATemplate`] containing the subject and
body of the e-mail that will be sent.

## <a name="BackgroundAction"></a>BackgroundAction

The `BackgroundAction` class provides a simplified way of calling
[`background_action()`].

{% include side-by-side.html demo="background_action_object" %}

The interview logic requires `answer` to be defined, which runs this
`code`:

{% highlight yaml %}
code: |
  answer = bg.run('bg_task', additional=value_to_add)
{% endhighlight %}

`bg` is defined by the `objects` block as a `BackgroundAction` object.

The interview logic needs a definition of `value_to_add`, so it asks
the `question` that defines `value_to_add`.

Once this is defined, then `bg.run()` can execute.

The first time `bg.run()` executes, it calls [`background_action()`]
on the provided positional and keyword arguments. Then it runs
[`command('wait')`]. This sends a response to the user's web browser,
telling the browser to try to reload the screen after four
seconds. Code execution is interrupted, so `answer` does not get
defined. The user sees a spinner.

When the browser tries to reload the screen after four seconds, the
interview logic runs again, and `bg.run()` is called again. This time,
`bg.run()` does not call [`background_action()`] and instead checks to
see if the background task has finished executing. If the background
task has not finished executing yet, [`command('wait')`] is called
again, and the browser tries again four seconds later. This process
repeats until the background task completes. If the background task
has completed, `.get()` is called on the task object and the value is
returned. Thus, `answer` is defined as the value returned by the
background task via `background_response()`.

Before returning the value, `bg` resets its state. Thus, if `bg.run()`
is called again, a new background task will be started. The fact that
`bg` resets its state when `bg.run()` returns a value means that you
need to be careful to write your interview logic so that `bg.run()` is
not run again unless you actually want a new background task to be
spawned.

In addition to `.run()`, `BackgroundAction` has the following methods:

* `.running()` returns `True` or `False` indicating the state of the
  `bg` object. If it returns `False`, then calling `.run()` will cause
  a background action to be spawned. If it returns `True`, then
  calling `.run()` will either cause [`command('wait')`] to run, or
  cause a response value to be returned.
* `.ready()` returns `True` if `.running()` is `True` and the
  underlyling background action has completed. It returns `False` if
  `.running()` is `True` and the underlyling background action has not
  completed. Otherwise, it returns `None`.

The `BackgroundAction` can be customized through subclassing. One
attribute and several methods can be overridden:

* `.refresh_seconds` is an attribute indicating the number of seconds
  the browser should be told to wait. The default value is `4`.
* `.initial_wait()` is called after `background_action()` is called to
  start the background action. The default method runs
  `command('wait', sleep=self.refresh_seconds)`.
* `.wait()` is called by `.run()` when the background task has started
  but has not completed. The default method runs
  `set_save_status('ignore')`
  and then
  `command('wait', sleep=self.refresh_seconds)`.
* `.process_response()` is called by `.run()` when the background task
  has completed successfully. It takes one argument, `result`, which
  is the `.result()` of the background task. The default method
  returns `result.value`.
* `.on_failure()` is called by `.run()` when the background task
  fails. It takes one argument, `result`, which is the `.result()` of
  the background task. The default method returns `result.value`.

# <a name="DAObject.using"></a>Special object method `using()`

If you wanted to initialize the variable `possession` as a [`DAList`]
of [`Thing`]s, you could write

{% highlight yaml %}
objects:
  - possession: DAList
---
mandatory: True
code: |
  possession.object_type = Thing
{% endhighlight %}

The [`DAObject`] class has a special object method, `using()`, which
can be used to accomplish the same thing in a more compact way, so
that you could instead write:

{% highlight yaml %}
objects:
  - possession: DAList.using(object_type=Thing)
{% endhighlight %}

You can use `using()` when indicating an `object_type`:

{% highlight yaml %}
objects:
  - client: Individual
  - possession: DAList.using(object_type=Thing.using(owner=client))
{% endhighlight %}

The result of this will be that `possession` is a [`DAList`] of
[`Thing`]s, and each item in the list will be initialized so that the
`owner` attribute is set to `client` by default.

The result of `.using()` can be used in a number of contexts,
including [`objects`] initial blocks, as a parameter in the methods
[`initializeAttribute()`], [`reInitializeAttribute()`],
[`appendObject()`], and [`gather()`], or as the [`object_type`]
attribute of a [`DAList`] or [`DADict`].

# <a name="language methods"></a>Methods for writing language programmatically

When you write `question`s in your [YAML], you may find that you need
to phrase language differently depending on variables. For example:

{% highlight yaml %}
question: |
  % if defendants.number() > 0:
  When did they first contact you?
  % elif defendants[0].gender == 'male':
  When did he first contact you?
  % elif defendants[0].gender == 'female':
  When did she first contact you?
  % endif
{% endhighlight %}

In some situations, writing multiple `if` statements to make slight
language changes is repetitive and inefficient.

**docassemble** objects have a variety of methods that can simplify
this process. For example, the above can be written:

{% highlight yaml %}
question: |
  When did ${ defendants.pronoun_subjective() } first contact you?
{% endhighlight %}

All classes that inherit from `DAObject` support the methods
`possessive()`, `object_possessive()`, `pronoun()`,
`pronoun_objective()`, `pronoun_subjective()`, `pronoun_possessive()`,
`is_are_you()`, `yourself_or_name()`, `itself()`, `is_user()`,
`do_question()`, `did_question()`, `were_question()`,
`have_question()`, `does_verb()`, `did_verb()`,
`subjective_pronoun_or_name()`, `pronoun_or_name()`, which are
demonstrated below.

{% include demo-side-by-side.html demo="daobject-language-functions" %}

## <a name="group language methods"></a>Methods for group objects

The classes `DAList`, `DADict`, and `DASet` support these methods as
well. If a list has just one element, calling the method on the list
has the same effect as calling the method on the first element of the
list. Otherwise, appropriate words are used recognizing the plural
nature of the object.

Suppose `plaintiffs` is a `DAList` with two items, where the textual
representation is `'Dick and Jane'`. Then:

* `plaintiffs.itself()` returns `'themselves'`.
* `plaintiffs.do_question('accept service')` returns `'do Dick and
  Jane accept service'`
* `plaintiffs.did_question('accept service')` returns `'did Dick and
  Jane accept service'`
* `plaintiffs.were_question('informed')` returns `'were Dick and
  Jane informed'`
* `plaintiffs.have_question('claimed')` returns `'have Dick and
  Jane claimed'`
* `plaintiffs.does_verb('claim')` returns `'Dick and
  Jane claim'`
* `plaintiffs.did_verb('claim')` returns `'Dick and
  Jane claimed'`
* `plaintiffs.pronoun_possessive('assertion')` returns `'their
  assertion'`.
* `plaintiffs.pronoun()` returns `'them'`.
* `plaintiffs.pronoun_objective()` returns `'them'` (same as
  `pronoun()`).
* `plaintiffs.pronoun_subjective()` returns `'they'`.

The `DAList`, `DADict`, and `DASet` classes also support some
additional language methods.

* `plaintiffs.as_noun()` returns `'plaintiffs'`, but if there was only
  one plaintiff, it would return `'plaintiff'`.
* `plaintiffs.as_noun('ox')` returns `'oxen'`, but if there was only
  one plaintiff, it would return `'ox'`.
* `plaintiffs.as_singular_noun()` returns `plaintiff` regardless of
  how many elements are in the list.
* `plaintiffs.number_as_word()` returns `'two'`.
* `plaintiffs.quantity_noun('ox')` returns `'two oxen'`, but if there
  was only one plaintiff, it would return `'one ox'`.

## <a name="point of view"></a>Point of view

The methods [`possessive()`], [`is_are_you()`],
[`yourself_or_name()`], [`itself()`], [`pronoun_possessive()`],
[`pronoun()`], [`pronoun_objective()`], [`pronoun_subjective()`],
[`do_question()`], [`did_question()`], [`were_question()`],
[`have_question()`], [`does_verb()`], [`did_verb()`],
[`subjective_pronoun_or_name()`], [`pronoun_or_name()`] use the
"second person" point of view if the object represents the user. You
indicate whether the object represents the user by calling
[`set_info()`].

{% highlight yaml %}
objects:
  - client: Individual
---
initial: True
code: |
  set_info(user=client)
{% endhighlight %}

This must be done every time the screen loads (which is what `initial:
True` means) because the interview might be a multi-user interview and
who the user is may depend on who the current user is.

The point of view can also be controlled manually. Each of the above
methods accepts the keyword argument `person`, which can be set to
one of the following values:

* `'1'` or `1` indicates "first person" (i.e. "I am", "me", "my apple").
* `'1p'` indicates "first person plural" (i.e. "we are", "us", "our apple").
* `'2'` or `2` indicates "second person" (i.e. "you are", "you", "your apple").
* `'2p'` indicates "second person plural" (same as "second person" in English).
* `'3'` or `3` indicates "third person" (i.e. "George is", "George,"
  "George's apple"). This is the default.

For example, if `client` is an individual named John Smith:

* `client.pronoun_possessive('apple', person=1)` returns `'my apple'`.
* `client.pronoun_possessive('apple', person='1p')` returns `'our apple'`.
* `client.pronoun_possessive('apple', person=2)` returns `'your apple'`.
* `client.pronoun_possessive('apple', person='2p')` returns `'your apple'`.
* `client.pronoun_possessive('apple', person=3)` returns `'his apple'`.

You can also set the special attribute `_point_of_view` on the object
itself to one of these values, and then that point of view will be
used as the default any time one of these language methods is called
on the object.

For example, if you write:

{% highlight yaml %}
objects:
  - company: Person.using(_point_of_view='1p')
{% endhighlight %}

then `company.pronoun_possessive('address')` will return `'our
address'`.

The following example demonstrates the different ways text can vary
based on the object and its point of view.

{% include demo-side-by-side.html demo="language-functions" %}

# <a name="instanceName"></a>How docassemble objects are different

For most purposes, **docassemble** objects behave just like [Python]
objects.  However, they have special properties that facilitate the
automatic asking of questions.  You may need to be mindful of these
special properties if you do anything fancy in your code.

In contrast to [Python objects] in general, **docassemble** objects
are aware of their first-given names.  All **docassemble** objects
have an `.instanceName` attribute.  So if you do:

{% highlight yaml %}
objects:
  - user: Individual
{% endhighlight %}

then `user.instanceName` will be `'user'`, and
`user.name.instanceName` will be `'user.name'`.

You can also initialize `user` in standard [Python] fashion:

{% highlight yaml %}
code: |
  user = Individual()
{% endhighlight %}

In this circumstance, **docassemble** uses some [magic] to set
`.instanceName` to `user`.  However, the magic has its limits.  For
example, the following does not work:

{% highlight yaml %}
code: |
  (user, advocate) = (Individual(), Individual())
{% endhighlight %}

If you ever get an error message in **docassemble** referring to
variables with a name like `qjAMyvGQYnyK`, and you are sure you did
not create such a variable, then you have an object that was unable to
determine its given name.

If you want to initialize objects using expressions more complicated
than `variable_name = ObjectName()`, you can -- you just need to
include the variable name as an argument to the object name.  For
example:

{% highlight yaml %}
code: |
  (user, advocate) = (Individual('user'), Individual('advocate'))
{% endhighlight %}

Attribute initialization does not have this limitation.

Always keep in mind that objects are given `.instanceName` attributes
as early as possible, and once an `.instanceName` is assigned, it will
not be overwritten unless you explicitly overwrite it.  For example,
if you do:

{% highlight yaml %}
code: |
  user.name = IndividualName()
{% endhighlight %}

then `user.name.instanceName` will return `'user.name'`, as you would
expect.  But if you do:

{% highlight yaml %}
code: |
  cool_name = IndividualName()
  cool_name.first = 'Groovy'
  cool_name.last = 'Jones'
---
code: |
  user.name = cool_name()
{% endhighlight %}

then `user.name.instanceName` will be `'cool_name'`, not `'user.name'`.

You can manually correct this:

{% highlight yaml %}
code: |
  user.name = cool_name()
  user.name.instanceName = 'user.name'
{% endhighlight %}

The `.instanceName` is not simply an internal attribute; it is used by
the [`.object_possessive()`] method to refer to the object in
human-readable format.

# <a name="writing"></a>Writing your own classes

If you know how to write your own [Python] code, it is pretty easy
to write your own classes.

For example, you could create your own [package] for interviews
related to cooking.

You would start by using the [package system] to create a
**docassemble** package called `cooking`, the full name of which would
be `docassemble.cooking` (interview packages are subpackages of the
`docassemble` namespace package).

You would create a module file within this package called
`objects.py`.  If you are using the [Playground], you would create
this file in the [Modules folder] of the [Playground].  Otherwise, you
would create this file in the `docassemble/cooking` directory in your
package.  You would set the contents of `objects.py` to the following:

{% highlight python %}
from docassemble.base.util import DAObject

class Recipe(DAObject):
    def summary(self):
        return "#### Ingredients\n\n" + self.ingredients + "\n\n#### Instructions\n\n" + self.instructions
{% endhighlight %}

Your class `Recipe` needs to "inherit" from the basic **docassemble**
object called [`DAObject`].  If you did not do this, **docassemble**
would not be able to ask questions to define attributes of `Recipe`
objects.

The purpose of the `summary()` method is to summarize the contents of
the recipe.  It makes use of the attributes `ingredients` and
`instructions`.

If you are not familiar with [Python], `\n` inside quotation marks
indicates a line break and `+` in the context of text indicates that
the text should be strung together.  In [Markdown], `####` at the
start of a line indicates that the line is a section name.

You can use your class in an interview like this:

{% include demo-side-by-side.html demo="testcooking" %}

Note that the [`modules`] block refers to `.objects`, which is a
[relative module name].  The `.` at the beginning means "in the
current package."  You could also have written
`docassemble.cooking.objects`.  The [relative module name] works so
long as the interview file is in the same package as the module.

By the way, there is way to write the `summary()` method that is more
friendly to other interview developers:

{% highlight python %}
from docassemble.base.util import DAObject, word

class Recipe(DAObject):
    def summary(self):
        return "#### " + word('Ingredients') + "\n\n" + self.ingredients + "\n\n#### " + word('Instructions') + "\n\n" + self.instructions
{% endhighlight %}

If you use the [`word()`] function in this way, interview developers will
be able to translate the "cooking" interview from English to another
language without having to edit your code.  All they would need to do
is include the words `Ingredients` and `Instructions` in a translation
[YAML] file referenced in a [`words`] directive in the **docassemble**
[configuration].

## <a name="ownclassattributes"></a>Initializing object attributes

In the example above, all the attributes of the `Recipe` object were
plain text values.  What if you want attributes of your objects to be
objects themselves?

Suppose you want the `ingredients` attribute to be a [`DAList`].

There are several ways that `ingredients` can be initialized.  In the
interview itself, you can do:

{% highlight yaml %}
modules:
  - docassemble.cooking
---
objects:
  - dinner: Recipe
  - dinner.ingredients: DAList
{% endhighlight %}

Or, you could use [`sets`] in combination with [`initializeAttribute()`]:

{% highlight yaml %}
modules:
  - docassemble.cooking
---
objects:
  - dinner: Recipe
---
generic object: Recipe
sets: x.ingredients
code: |
  x.initializeAttribute('ingredients', DAList)
{% endhighlight %}

However, it is often cleaner to put the object initialization into the
class definition itself:

{% highlight python %}
class Recipe(DAObject):
    def init(self, *pargs, **kwargs):
        self.initializeAttribute('ingredients', DAList)
        super().init(*pargs, **kwargs)
{% endhighlight %}

Then, you would only need to write this in your interview file:

{% highlight yaml %}
objects:
  - dinner: Recipe
{% endhighlight %}

<a name="DAObject.init"></a>The `init()` function is a special
function that is called on all [`DAObject`] objects at the time they
are initialized.  This is not to be confused with the `__init__()`
function, which is built in to [Python]; you should use `init()`, not
`__init__()`.

When you write your own `init()` function for a class, you should (but
are not required to) include the `super().init(*pargs,
**kwargs)` line.  This will ensure that `Recipe` objects are
initialized properly.  For example, if you wrote:

{% highlight python %}
dinner.initializeAttribute('recipe', Recipe, oven_temperature=300)
{% endhighlight %}

then `dinner.recipe` would be a `Recipe` object and
`dinner.recipe.oven_temperature` would be `300`.  However, if you
included an `init()` function and failed to include
`super().init(*pargs, **kwargs)`, then the `oven_temperature` variable
would not be set.  Therefore, it is a good practice to always write
your `init()` methods in this way.

Before you use objects and [inheritance], you should buy a [Python
book] and learn how [Python] handles object orientation.  Object
oriented programming is an advanced topic and **docassemble**
documentation is not a substitute for [Python] documentation.

## <a name="usingglob"></a>Using global variables in your classes

Normally in [Python] you can use global variables to keep track of
information that your methods need to know but that is not passed in
arguments to the methods.  For example, if you wanted to keep track of
whether to use Celsius or Fahrenheit when talking about temperatures,
you might be tempted to write:

{% highlight python %}
from docassemble.base.util import DAObject

temperature_type = 'Celsius'

class Recipe(DAObject):
    def summary(self):
        return "#### Ingredients\n\n" + self.ingredients + "\n\n#### Instructions\n\n" + self.instructions
    def get_oven_temperature(self):
        if temperature_type == 'Celsius':
            return str(self.oven_temperature) + ' °C'
        elif temperature_type == 'Fahrenheit':
            return str(self.oven_temperature) + ' °F'
        elif temperature_type == 'Kelvin':
            return str(self.oven_temperature) + ' K'
{% endhighlight %}

(The `str()` function is a Python function that converts something to
text.  Here, it is necessary because `self.oven_temperature` may be a
number, and [Python] will complain if you ask it to "add" text to a
number.)

Then to change the `temperature_type` from an interview, you might
write:

{% highlight yaml %}
modules:
  - docassemble.cooking.objects
---
initial: True
code: |
  if user_is_scientist:
    temperature_type = 'Kelvin'
  elif user_country in ['United States', 'Great Britain']:
    temperature_type = 'Fahrenheit'
{% endhighlight %}

This would be effective at changing the `temperature_type` variable
because the `modules` block loads all the names from
`docassemble.cooking.objects` into the [namespace] of the interview,
including `temperature_type`.

However, this is not [thread-safe] and it will not work correctly 100%
of the time.  If your server is under heavy load, users might randomly
be advised to turn their ovens to 350 degrees Celsius, which would
scorch the food.  This is because the variable `temperature_type`
exists at the level of the web server process, and the process might
be supporting several users simultaneously (in different "threads" of
the process).  Between the time one user sets `temperature_type` to
`Fahrenheit` and tries to use it, another user inside the same process
might set `temperature_type` to `Celsius`.

Therefore, it is important that you do not use global variables when
you write your own classes.  The simplest way to get around this
problem is to use the [`set_info()`] and [`get_info()`] functions from
[`docassemble.base.util`]:

{% highlight python %}
from docassemble.base.util import DAObject, get_info

class Recipe(DAObject):
    def summary(self):
        return "#### Ingredients\n\n" + self.ingredients + "\n\n#### Instructions\n\n" + self.instructions
    def get_oven_temperature(self):
        if get_info('temperature_type') == 'Celsius':
            return str(self.oven_temperature) + ' °C'
        elif get_info('temperature_type') == 'Fahrenheit':
            return str(self.oven_temperature) + ' °F'
        elif get_info('temperature_type') == 'Kelvin':
            return str(self.oven_temperature) + ' K'
{% endhighlight %}

Then from your interview you can run [`set_info()`] in [`initial`]
code:

{% highlight yaml %}
modules:
  - docassemble.cooking.objects
---
initial: True
code: |
  if user_is_scientist:
    set_info(temperature_type='Kelvin')
  elif user_country in ['United States', 'Great Britain']:
    set_info(temperature_type='Fahrenheit')
  else:
    set_info(temperature_type='Celsius')
{% endhighlight %}

The values set by [`set_info()`] are forgotten after the user's screen
is prepared.  Therefore, it is necessary to run [`set_info()`] in an
[`initial`] code block so that values like `temperature_type` are put
in place before they are needed.

If you are an advanced programmer, you can do what
[`docassemble.base.util`] does and use Python's [threading module] to
store global variables.

{% highlight python %}
from docassemble.base.util import DAObject
import threading

__all__ = ['set_temperature_type', 'get_temperature_type', 'Recipe']

this_thread = threading.local

def set_temperature_type(type):
    this_thread.temperature_type = type

def get_temperature_type():
    return this_thread.temperature_type

class Recipe(DAObject):
    def summary(self):
        return "#### Ingredients\n\n" + self.ingredients + "\n\n#### Instructions\n\n" + self.instructions
    def get_oven_temperature(self):
        if this_thread.temperature_type == 'Celsius':
            return str(self.oven_temperature) + ' °C'
        elif this_thread.temperature_type == 'Fahrenheit':
            return str(self.oven_temperature) + ' °F'
        elif this_thread.temperature_type == 'Kelvin':
            return str(self.oven_temperature) + ' K'
{% endhighlight %}

We added an `__all__` statement so that a `module` block including
`docassemble.cooking.objects` does not clutter the [namespace] with
extraneous names like `threading`.  We also added functions for
setting and retrieving the value of the "temperature type."

The temperature type is now an attribute of the object `this_thread`,
which is an instance of `threading.local`.  This attribute needs to be
set in `initial` code that will run every time a screen refreshes.

Now in your interview you can do:

{% highlight yaml %}
modules:
  - docassemble.cooking.objects
---
initial: True
code: |
  if user_is_scientist:
    set_temperature_type('Kelvin')
  elif user_country in ['United States', 'Great Britain']:
    set_temperature_type('Fahrenheit')
  else:
    set_temperature_type('Celsius')
{% endhighlight %}

Note that you do not need to worry about whether your global variables
are [thread-safe] if they do not change from interview to interview.

For example, if you only wanted to allow people to change the
temperature type from the **docassemble** [configuration], you could
do the following in your [Python module]:

{% highlight python %}
from docassemble.base.util import DAObject

from docassemble.webapp.config import daconfig
temperature_type = daconfig.get('temperature type', 'Celsius')
{% endhighlight %}

Then your interviews would not have to do anything with `temperature_type`.

Also, you could avoid the complication of global variables entirely if
you are willing to pass the temperature type as an argument to
`get_oven_temperature`:

{% highlight python %}
from docassemble.base.util import DAObject

class Recipe(DAObject):
    def get_oven_temperature(self, type):
        if type == 'Celsius':
            return str(self.oven_temperature) + ' °C'
        elif type == 'Fahrenheit':
            return str(self.oven_temperature) + ' °F'
        elif type == 'Kelvin':
            return str(self.oven_temperature) + ' K'
{% endhighlight %}

Then you could have this in your interview:

{% highlight yaml %}
question: |
  What kind of temperature system do you use?
choices:
  - Celsius
  - Fahrenheit
  - Kelvin
field: temperature_type
{% endhighlight %}

and then in your question text you could write:

{% highlight text %}
Set your oven to ${ apple_pie.get_oven_temperature(temperature_type) }
and let it warm up.
{% endhighlight %}

## <a name="extending"></a>Extending existing classes

If you want to add a method to an existing **docassemble** class, such
as [`Individual`], you do not need to reinvent the wheel or copy and
paste code from anywhere.  Just take advantage of [inheritance].

For example, if your package is `docassemble.missouri_family_law`, you
could create/edit the file
`docassemble/missouri_family_law/objects.py` and add the following:

{% highlight python %}
from docassemble.base.util import Individual

class Attorney(Individual):
    def can_practice_in(self, state):
        if state in self.bar_admissions and self.bar_admissions[state] is True:
            return True
        return False
{% endhighlight %}

Here you are defining the class `Attorney` as a subclass of
[`Individual`].  An object that is an instance of the `Attorney` class
will also be an instance of the [`Individual`] class.  The `Attorney`
class is said to "inherit" from the [`Individual`] class.  All of the
methods that can be used on an [`Individual`] can be used on an
`Attorney`.

This allows you to write an interview like the following:

{% include side-by-side.html demo="attorney" %}

Note that the `lawyer` object works just like an [`Individual`]
object.  The `is_are_you()` method works on the `Attorney` object just
as it works on any [`Individual`].

Note that the `can_practice_in()` method is only available for
`Attorney` objects.  If you added the following to the above
interview:

{% highlight yaml %}
objects:
  - user: Individual
---
mandatory: True
question: |
  % if user.can_practice_in('MA'):
  You can take this case yourself.
  % else:
  You will need to hire a lawyer to take the case.
  % endif
{% endhighlight %}

then you would get an error because `can_practice_in()` is not a valid
method for `user`, which is only an instance of the [`Individual`] class
and not an instance of the `Attorney` class.

When subclassing standard **docassemble** classes, keep in mind that
some standard **docassemble** classes have `init()` functions that
initialize attributes that are themselves standard **docassemble**
classes.  For example, when an object of class [`Individual`] is
created, the attribute `name` is defined as an object of class
[`IndividualName`].

Suppose that you wanted your `Attorney` objects to have a `name`
attribute that was an `AttorneyName` rather than an `IndividualName`.
One way to implement this would be to write:

{% highlight python %}
from docassemble.base.util import Individual, IndividualName

class AttorneyName(IndividualName):
    def full(self, middle='initial', use_suffix=True):
        return super().full(middle=middle, use_suffix=use_suffix) + ', Esq.'

class Attorney(Individual):
    def init(self, *pargs, **kwargs):
        self.initializeAttribute('name', AttorneyName)
        super().init(*pargs, **kwargs)
{% endhighlight %}

Note that the `init()` method first initializes `name` and then calls
the parent class `init()` method.  This works because the `init()`
method of the [`Individual`] class defines `name` with the
`initializeAttribute()` method, which returns without doing anything
if the attribute is already defined.  So the `init()` method of
`Individual` will not overwrite the `name`.

There is a second way to customize standard **docassemble** classes
that initialize attributes.  The [`Individual`] and [`Person`] classes
have a special class attribute `NameClass` that is set to
[`IndividualName`] for the [`Individual`] class and [`Name`] for the
[`Person`] class.  Thus, all you need to do to to indicate that
your `Attorney` objects should use `AttorneyName` as the class for the
`name` is to set the class attribute `NameClass` to `AttorneyName`:

{% highlight python %}
from docassemble.base.util import Individual, IndividualName

class AttorneyName(IndividualName):
    def full(self, middle='initial', use_suffix=True):
        return super().full(middle=middle, use_suffix=use_suffix) + ', Esq.'

class Attorney(Individual):
    NameClass = AttorneyName
{% endhighlight %}

These are the class attributes that standard **docassemble** objects
use:

* `Address`, `Event`, and `Person` set the class attribute
  `LatitudeLongitudeClass` to `LatitudeLongitude`.  This is the class
  used for the `location` attribute.
* `Thing` and `Person` set the class attribute `NameClass` to `Name`.
  This is the class used for the `name` attribute.
* `Event` sets the class attribute `CityClass` to `City`.  This is the
  class used for the `address` attribute.
* `Person` sets the class attribute `NameClass` to `Name`.  This is
  the class used for the `name` attribute.
* `Person` sets the class attribute `AddressClass` to `Address`.  This
  is the class used for the `address` attribute.
* `Individual` sets the class attribute `NameClass` to
  `IndividualName`.  This is the class used for the `name` attribute.
* `ChildList` sets the class attribute `ChildClass` to `Individual`.
  The `object_type` attribute is set to this class during the `init()`
  method.
* `FinancialList` sets the class attribute `ValueClass` to `Value`.
  The `object_type` attribute is set to this class during the `init()`
  method.
* `PeriodicFinancialList` sets the class attribute
  `PeriodicValueClass` to `PeriodicValue`.  The `object_type`
  attribute is set to this class during the `init()` method.
* `OfficeList` sets the class attribute `AddressClass` to `Address`.
  The `object_type` attribute is set to this class during the `init()`
  method.
* `Organization` sets the class attribute `OfficeListClass` to
  `OfficeList`.  This is the class used for the `office` attribute.

In `docassemble.base.legal`:

* `Case` sets the class attribute `PartyListClass` to `PartyList`.
  This is the class used for the `plaintiff`, `defendant`,
  `petitioner`, `respondent`, `appellee`, and `appellant` attributes.
* `Case` sets the class attribute `CourtClass` to `Court`.  This is
  the class used for the `court` attribute.

## <a name="mixin"></a>Using mixins

Sometimes it can be useful to define a method that can be used on
multiple classes.  Python allows you to do this with "multiple
inheritance" and "mixin" classes.

Here is an example of overriding the `possessive()` method of
subclasses of [`Individual`] and [`Person`].  By using a "mixin," you
can avoid writing the same method in two different places.

{% highlight python %}
from docassemble.base.util import Person, Individual

class MyPersonMixin(object):
  def possessive(self, target, **kwargs):
    the_word = str(self)
    if the_word[-1] == 's' and 'plural' not in kwargs:
      kwargs['plural'] = True
    return super().possessive(target, **kwargs)

class MyPerson(MyPersonMixin, Person):
  def some_function(self):
     return 2 + 2

class MyIndividual(MyPersonMixin, Individual):
  def some_other_function(self):
     return 2 + 6
{% endhighlight %}

## <a name="prevent_dependency_satisfaction"></a>Preventing dependency satisfaction

**docassemble**'s dependency satisfaction process can be used from
inside methods.  For example, you have an class `Legume` with a method
`.is_tasty()`, which references `self.savory_index`, running
`.is_tasty()` can trigger a [`question`] to be asked if the
`savory_index` attribute is needed and is not defined.

{% highlight python %}
class Legume(Thing):
    def is_tasty(self):
        if self.sweet_index > 5 or self.savory_index > 6:
            return True
        else:
            return False
{% endhighlight %}

However, this feature can also cause confusion, because if you make a
mistake when coding a method and refer to a non-existent name,
**docassemble** will try to obtain a definition for that name in the
interview itself.  Although the namespace of a method is different
from the namespace of the interview answers, **docassemble** doesn't
know the difference.  The symptoms of this might be very confusing,
because you might see strange behavior instead of an error message.

The automatic dependency satisfaction system can also be a problem
when the code in your method needs to run idempotently.  For example,
if your code appends records to a database, you may find that
mysterious duplicate entries are appearing in the database; this can
happen if your method references an undefined variable that
**docassemble**'s dependency satisfaction [logic] is able to define.

You can turn off **docassemble**'s dependency satisfaction logic for a
method by using the `prevent_dependency_satisfaction` [decorator].
This [decorator] is defined in the [`docassemble.base.util`] module.

Here is an example module called `legume.py` that uses the
`prevent_dependency_satisfaction` decorator.

{% highlight python %}
from docassemble.base.util import Thing, prevent_dependency_satisfaction

__all__ = ['Legume']

class Legume(Thing):
    @prevent_dependency_satisfaction
    def is_tasty(self):
        if self.sweet_index > 5 or self.savory_index > 6:
            return True
        else:
            return False
{% endhighlight %}

Here is an interview that uses the `legume` module and the `Legume` class:

{% include demo-side-by-side.html demo="prevent-dependency-satisfaction" %}

If `@prevent_dependency_satisfaction` had not been applied to the
method, then the `savory_index` attribute would have been gathered
from the user.  The `prevent_dependency_satisfaction` [decorator]
instead forces an exception to be raised.

The code for `prevent_dependency_satisfaction` is very simple; it
basically just wraps the method in a `try`/`except` and raises a
generic [`Exception`] if any exception is raised from inside the
method.

# <a name="DADateTime"></a>Special date/time class `DADateTime`

When you set a variable with [`datatype: date`], or use one of the
[date functions] that returns a date, the variable is a special object
of the class `DADateTime`.  This object is special to **docassemble**,
but it is not a [`DAObject`].  You cannot create these with an
[`objects`] block.  (If you want to create one, use
[`as_datetime()`].)

The [`DADateTime`] object is a subclass of [`datetime.datetime`],
which is a standard [Python] class for working with dates and times.
This means that anything that you can do with a [`datetime.datetime`]
object can also be done with a [`DADateTime`] object.

The [`DADateTime`] object also has some additional functionality that
the traditional [`datetime.datetime`] object does not have, such as
the attributes `dow` for day of week and `week` for the week of the
year.

If `birthday` is defined by `as_datetime('4/1/2018')`, then:

* `birthday.day` is 1
* `birthday.month` is 4
* `birthday.year` is 2018
* `birthday.week` is 13
* `birthday.dow` is 7 (Sunday)
* `birthday.hour` is 0
* `birthday.minute` is 0
* `birthday.second` is 0
* `birthday.microsecond` is 0

<a name="DADateTime.plus"></a><a name="DADateTime.minus"></a>The
[`DADateTime`] object also has methods `.plus()` and `.minus()` that
allow you to add or subtract periods of time from a date.

* `birthday.plus(weeks=3)` returns a [`DADateTime`] object representing April 29, 2018.
* `birthday.plus(months=1)` returns a [`DADateTime`] object representing May 1, 2018.
* `birthday.minus(years=2)` returns a [`DADateTime`] object representing April 1, 2020.

The available keyword arguments to `.plus()` and `.minus()` are:

* `years`
* `months`
* `days`
* `weeks`
* `hours`
* `minutes`
* `seconds`
* `microseconds`

The `.plus()` and `.minus()` methods use
[`dateutil.relativedelta.relativedelta`] to calculate dates and times.
The [`date_interval()`] function can be used to do similar
calculations.  For example, `birthday.plus(weeks=1)` is equivalent to
doing `birthday + date_interval(weeks=1)`.

<a name="DADateTime.format"></a><a name="DADateTime.format_date"></a><a name="DADateTime.format_time"></a><a name="DADateTime.format_datetime"></a>The
[`DADateTime`] object also has methods for formatting dates and times.

* `birthday.format()` is `'April 1, 2018'`.
* `birthday.format_date()` is `'April 1, 2018'` (identical to `.format()`)
* `birthday.format_date('MMM')` is `'Apr'`
* `birthday.format_time()` is `'12:00 AM'`
* `birthday.format_time('h:mm a z')` is `'12:00 AM EST'`, or whatever the
  current time zone is.
* `current_datetime().format_time('h:mm')` returns the current time,
  formatted like `'12:00'`.
* `current_datetime().format_datetime()` returns the current time,
  formatted like `'January 1, 2018 at 12:00:00 AM EST'`.

These functions have the same effect as the [`format_date()`],
[`format_time()`], and [`format_datetime()`] functions.  In fact,
`birthday.format_date('long')` simply calls `format_date(birthday,
format='long')`.  The `.format()` method is the same as
`.format_date()`.  See the documentation for the [date functions] for
details.  An interview-wide date/time format string can be set in the
interview [`metadata`] or through the [`set_parts()`]
function.

When a [`DADateTime`] is converted to text, for example when it is
included in a [Mako] template with `${ birthday }`, the text
conversion is done using [`format_date()`].

<a name="DADateTime.replace"></a>The `.replace()` method returns a new
[`DADateTime`] object that is the same as the original object, except
with altered components.  For example, `birthdate.replace(year=2018)`
will return the date of a person's birthday in 2018.  The available
parameters are `year`, `month`, `day`, `hour` (0 to 23), `minute`,
`second`, and `microsecond`.  See [`datetime.datetime.replace()`].

<a name="DADateTime.replace_time"></a>A method that is similar to
`.replace()` is `.replace_time()`, which returns a [`DADateTime`]
object with all of the time-related values set to those of a given
[`datetime.time`] object.  If you ask the user a question and you use
a field with [`datatype: time`], the resulting variable is a
[`datetime.time`] object.  You can combine [`datatype: date`] and
[`datatype: time`] objects using `.replace_time()`:

{% include side-by-side.html demo="date-and-time-fields" %}

<a name="DADateTime.time"></a>If you only want to use the time portion
of a [`DADateTime`], use the `.time()` method, which returns a
[`datetime.time`] object containing only the time-related information
of the original [`DADateTime`] object.  See
[`datetime.datetime.time()`].

# <a name="SQLObject"></a>Special class `SQLObject`

The `SQLObject` is a special class that makes an ordinary [`DAObject`]
automatically synchronize with a [SQL] database.

Object instances that inherit from this class will have the full
functionality of ordinary object instances, but with the added feature
that particular attributes (or attributes of sub-objects) will
synchronize with a [SQL] database.

The `SQLObject` is an expert feature. Using it requires:

* Knowing how [SQL] databases work;
* Knowing how to create a [SQL] database;
* Knowing how to use [SQLAlchemy];
* Knowing how object oriented programming works;
* Knowing how to write [custom classes] in a [Python module] file; and
* Knowing how to use [Alembic] (potentially).

Here is an example of the use of `SQLObject`:

{% include demo-side-by-side.html demo="testdatabase" %}

The `Customer` and `Bank` classes are defined in the `demodb.py` file.
`Customer` is a subclass of `Individual` and `SQLObject` (using
[multiple inheritance]).  `Bank` is a subclass of `Person` and
`SQLObject`.  Behind every `Customer` is a row in a [SQL] table
listing customers.  Behind every `Bank` is a row in a [SQL] table
listing banks.  These tables are in a separate [SQL] database from the
database where **docassemble**'s interview answers are stored.  This
[SQL] database can be any database capable of being accessed using
[SQLAlchemy].  The database tables can be pre-existing (e.g., a
database for a case management system) or created for the sole purpose
of storing data from interviews.  If the tables do not exist,
[SQLAlchemy] will create them when the module loads.

In the interview, the user is first asked for a unique identifier
(SSN) about the `customer`.  If the the SSN matches the SSN of a
record in the customer table in [SQL], the attributes of the
`customer` object are populated with the values in [SQL], and then the
interview doesn't need to ask the user for the customer's name and
address.  If the SSN does not match the SSN of a record in the
customer table, a new row is added to [SQL] table, and the user is
asked for the customer's name and address.  After each screen, the
[SQL] table is updated with the information that is acquired.

Then the interview performs a similar process with the `bank`.  The
unique identifier for a `Bank` is a routing number.  The interview
needs to know the name of the `bank`.

Finally the interview makes the `customer` a customer of the `bank` by
adding an entry to a table in [SQL] that tracks relationships between
banks and customers.  It does this with a custom method
`add_customer()`, the code for which is in `demodb.py`.

Here is the code for `demodb.py`.

This example uses the `alchemy_url()` function to refer to a database
configuration called `demo db`.  This assumes that there is a
directive called `demo db` in the [Configuration] that specifies a
connection to a SQL database, following the same layout of the [`db`]
directive.

{% highlight yaml %}
demo db:
  name: demo
  user: jsmith
  password: supersecret
{% endhighlight %}

The above module file contains the line:

{% highlight python %}
Base.metadata.create_all(engine)
{% endhighlight %}

This [SQLAlchemy] command creates database tables for any models that
have been defined in Python code. Thus, the mere loading of this
module causes database tables to come into existence if they do not
already exist.

While the tables will be created automatically by [SQLAlchemy] if they
do not exist, the database itself (which in this example is named
`demo`) will need to be created beforehand. You also need to make sure
that the database user (in the above example, `jsmith`) has full
privileges to the database.

Note that while [SQLAlchemy] is capable of creating database tables,
it is not capable of modifying them if you edit the model classes
after the database tables have already been created. If you are the
only user of the module that uses [`SQLObject`], you could get around
this problem by making the changes to your database tables
manually. However, if you have released your module to the public, and
someone who is using your module upgrades to your latest version, they
will encounter errors because your code will use the new version of
the model but the actual database table will be using the earlier
version of the model.

[Alembic] is a version control system for [SQLAlchemy] that solves
this problem. Using [Alembic] requires adding a configuration file and
an `alembic` folder to the package in which your [`SQLObject`] module
lives. Thus, you will need to prepare your package from the command
line. You cannot do this from within the [Playground]. If you do not
already have your package on your personal computer, you will need to
download it.

To get started, install [alembic] on your personal computer:

{% highlight bash %}
pip install alembic
{% endhighlight %}

Then, go into the directory where your module file is located.  For
example, if your package is called `docassemble.foobar`, do:

{% highlight bash %}
cd docassemble-foobar/docassemble/foobar
{% endhighlight %}

From here, run the following command to initialize [alembic]:

{% highlight bash %}
alembic init alembic
{% endhighlight %}

Whenever you want to create a revision to your database structure, you
run a command like:

{% highlight bash %}
alembic revision -m "add column for phone"
{% endhighlight %}

The [Alembic] directory structure will look something like this:

{% highlight text %}
docassemble-foobar
|-- docassemble
|   |-- foobar
|   |   |-- alembic.ini
|   |   |-- alembic
|   |   |   |-- env.py
|   |   |   |-- script.py.mako
|   |   |   |-- versions
|   |   |   |   `-- 5627e6ca17d18_add_column_for_phone.py
|   |   |-- data
|   |   |   |-- questions
|   |   |   |   `-- myinterview.yml
|   |   |   |-- static
|   |   |   |   `-- logo.jpg
|   |   |   |-- sources
|   |   |   |   `-- data.yml
|   |   |   `-- templates
|   |   |       `-- mytemplate.docx
|   |   |-- mydb.py
|   |   `-- __init__.py
|   `-- __init__.py
|-- LICENSE
|-- README.md
|-- setup.cfg
`-- setup.py
{% endhighlight %}

In this file listing, `5627e6ca17d18_add_column_for_phone.py` is a
file that was created by running `alembic revision`. The code
`5627e6ca17d18` represents a version. Each "version" file contains a
reference to the current version and the previous version, along with
code that indicates how to upgrade from the old version to the new
version, and how to downgrade from the new version to the old
version.

After running `alembic revision`, you need to edit the resulting
"version" file (in this example,
`5627e6ca17d18_add_column_for_phone.py`) and write [SQLAlchemy] code
in the `upgrade()` and `downgrade()` functions to modify the database
tables in the appropriate ways to effectuate the change you made to
the model.

[Alembic] keeps track of the current version using a table in the
database containing one row and one column. By scanning the files in
`versions` and looking at the current version, [Alembic] knows which
files in the `versions` directory it needs to run to perform an
upgrade.

The above module example contains code that calls [Alembic].

{% highlight python %}
upgrade_db(url, __file__, engine, version_table='auto', conn_args=conn_args)
{% endhighlight %}

This function calls [Alembic] to perform any necessary upgrades. When
the `version_table` parameter is set to `'auto'`, that means that the
name of the table in the database that [Alembic] uses to track the
current version will be based on the name of the package. If
`version_table` is set to `None`, the default name of
`alembic_version` will be used. If the database you are using is
already serving as the [`db`] database of a **docassemble** server,
there will be a conflict because the **docassemble** server uses
[Alembic] with `alembic_version` as the name of its version table. You
can also set `version_table` to a string, in which case the name of
the version table will be that string.

For examples of what the [Alembic]-related files should look like, see
the [`docassemble.demo`] package and consult the [Alembic]
documentation. The [`docassemble.webapp`] package contains `version`
files that you can look at to get a sense of what the `upgrade()` and
`downgrade()` functions should look like.

## <a name="sqlobject how it works"></a>How it works

The [`SQLObject`] facilitates synchronization of values between
"[Python] land" and "[SQL] land."  It is important to understand that
there are fundamental differences between these two "lands."

In [Python] land, there are [Python] objects with attributes.  These
can be arbitrarily nested; attributes can be objects themselves, which
have their own attributes, and so on.  An attribute might be an alias
for an object that has an independent existence elsewhere, such as
when you declare `case.plaintiff = client`.

In [SQL] land, there are database tables made up of rows and columns,
where a row represents a single record and the columns are named data
values, each of which has a specific data type.  [SQL] tables
typically have a column that functions as a "key," which typically
contains an auto-incrementing integer.  Columns in a [SQL] table often
have "constraints."  In some columns, uniqueness is enforced; for
example, it might be illegal for two rows in a table to have the same
value for a column representing an e-mail address.

In [Python] land, you can add attributes to an object whenever you
want.  In [SQL] land, adding a column to a table is something you have
to do in advance, and it has imporant implications for the future of
your database.  In [Python] land, you can nest objects arbitrarily.
In [SQL] land, creating relationships among objects requires using
separate tables: one table for the first object type, a second table
for the second object type, and a third table that holds a mapping
between first table and the second table.

There are many other differences between what is possible with
**docassemble** interview answers represented as [Python] objects, and
what is possible in [SQL] tables.

As a result of all of these differences, there is never going to be a
perfect one-to-one correspondence between [SQL] tables and
**docassemble** objects.  Going between these two worlds is a process
of translation.  You need to specify exactly how you want this
translation to happen.

The [`SQLObject`] system associates a particular [Python class] with a
particular [SQL] table.  Any object of this class in the interview
answers will have a corresponding row in the [SQL] table.  Each
separate [Python class] that inherits from [`SQLObject`] will get its
own separate [SQL] table.  Columns in the [SQL] table are associated
with particular attributes of the object in [Python] land.

It is not a problem if the objects in [Python] land have attributes
that do not map to columns in [SQL] land.  Likewise, it is not a
problem if the tables in [SQL] land have columns that do not map to
information in [Python] land.  The interview answers will still
continue to save any "extra" attributes, and any "extra" columns in
the [SQL] database will not disturb [Python].

The synchronization process is hooked into **docassemble**'s existing
[pickling] system.  When a screen loads, **docassemble** reads the
[pickled] interview answers from its database, un[pickles] them,
applies the [interview logic] to the interview answers, figures out
what [`question`] to ask, [pickles] the interview answers, saves the
[pickled] answers to the database again, and then shows the
[`question`] to the user.  In the process of un[pickling], if a
[`DAObject`] that is also a [`SQLObject`] is encountered,
**docassemble** will find the row in the [SQL] table associated with the
object type and use the values in each of the columns to change
information about the [Python] object.  Likewise, when [pickling],
**docassemble** will update the row in [SQL] if any changes to the
relevant information have been made.

When you first create a [`DAObject`], it might have no attributes
except for an [`instanceName`].  This is enough for the object to be
saved in the interview answers, but it isn't enough to create a new
record in [SQL].  It doesn't make sense to create a new record in [SQL] if
all the columns are null.  Until there is enough information to
populate the "required" columns, the object is said to be "nascent."
The object will automatically become non-nascent when the information
for the "required" columns is known and the new record is created in
the [SQL] database.

Objects can also become non-nascent if information for the "unique ID"
column is gathered, and a record exists for that unique ID.  The
object will automatically become non-nascent when the columns of the
record are read from the [SQL] database and used to populate
attributes of the [`DAObject`].  For example, in the interview above,
if you create a "customer" with a particular SSN during one interview
session, and then in a subsequent interview session you input the same
SSN, the remaining attributes of the [`DAObject`] will be populated.
In other words, all you have to do is create a "shell" object of type
[`Individual`] with the `ssn` attribute defined, and then, as part of
the automatic synchronization process, all of the other attributes of
the [`Individual`] will be populated.

For purposes of creating a new record in [SQL], the "unique ID" column
is treated as one of the "required" columns that must be defined
before a new record can be created in the [SQL] database table.  Thus,
if you want to use an object in your interview answers but you don't
want it saved to [SQL], and the object uses a "unique ID" column, just
refrain from defining the information for the "unique ID" column, and
it will never synchronize with the [SQL] table.

The "nascent" stage of an object allows you to use several screens to
collect information about an item before writing anything to the SQL
database; the information is stored in the interview answers but not
in the SQL database.  This allows you to use the interview answers as
a kind of "staging area" for information before writing it to the SQL
database.

If an object is stored both in the interview answers and on the SQL
server, and then the columns in the SQL record change, then the next
time the interview answers are retrieved, the attributes in the Python
objects will be updated with the values in SQL.

However, if the item is deleted from SQL, then when the corresponding
Python object is retrieved, it will become a "zombie" object.  It will
continue to have the attributes that were known the last time the
object was synchronized with SQL, but it will be disconnected from the
SQL database and will only exist as an ordinary Python object in the
interview answers.

The "nascent" quality of an object is tracked internally using the
instance attribute [`_nascent`] (which will be `True` or `False`).
The "zombie" quality of an object is tracked using the instance
attribute [`_zombie`] (which will be `True` or `False`).

The "required" attributes are defined by setting the [`_required`]
attribute of the class.  (Note that a class attribute is different
from an instance attribute; a class attribute is read-only and is
defined in the [Python module] file, whereas instance attributes can
be added, deleted, or modified at any time.)  The "unique ID" of a
class is defined by setting the [`_uid`] attribute of the class.  For
example, in the above [Python module], the [`_required`] class
attribute was set to `'first_name'` and the [`_uid`] attribute name
was set to `'ssn'`.

The mapping between the [`DAObject`] characteristics and the values of
database columns is controlled by the [`db_get()`], [`db_set()`], and
[`db_null()`] methods of the class.  The [`db_get()`] method takes a
column name and tries to obtain a value for it from [Python] land.
The [`db_set()`] method takes a column name and a value from [SQL]
land and saves that value in [Python] land. (Think of the verbs "get"
and "set" as applying to attributes of the Python object, not columns
in the SQL record.) For example, in the above [Python module], the
`first_name` column is associated with `.name.first` attribute of the
`Customer` object.  The [`db_null()`] method takes a column name and
tries to delete the object attribute in [Python] land that is
associated with the given column.

When you initialize an object, you can give it the unique ID, and if
a record exists in SQL with that unique ID, then the object will be
non-nascent from the start.

{% highlight yaml %}
objects:
  - customer: Customer.using(ssn='928-32-2832')
{% endhighlight %}

In addition, every table in SQL has a column called `id`, which is a
unique integer that never changes.  The `id` is set when the record is
created in [SQL], using an auto-incrementing counter.  If you know the
`id` of a record you can use it to initialize your object so that it
is non-nascent from the start.  For example, here is a way to use a
URL parameter (or in the alternative, a [`question`]), to get the `id`
for a customer record:

{% highlight yaml %}
objects:
  - customer: Customer.using(id=customer_id)
---
question: |
  What is the customer ID?
fields:
  - ID: customer_id
    datatype: integer
---
code: |
  if 'id' in url_args:
    customer_id = url_args['id']
{% endhighlight %}

If you initialize an object as nascent, but later set its unique ID,
and then call [`db_read()`] or [`db_save()`], **docassemble** will
look for a record in the database for that unique ID, and if it finds
it, it will run [`db_set()`] and update information in [Python] based on
the values of the columns in [SQL].

For example, assume there is a customer in the [SQL] database with SSN
122-23-2322, whose first name is John and whose last name is Smith.

{% highlight yaml %}
objects:
  - customer: Customer
---
mandatory: True
code: |
  customer.ssn = '122-23-2322'
  # customer is still nascent
  customer.db_read()
  # customer is no longer nascent
  customer.name.first
  # this does not trigger the asking of a question, because
  # customer.name.first is defined as 'John'
{% endhighlight %}

For another example, assume there is not a customer in the [SQL]
database with SSN 545-23-6552.

{% highlight yaml %}
objects: |
  customer: Customer
---
mandatory: True
code: |
  customer.ssn = '545-23-6552'
  # customer is still nascent
  customer.db_save()
  # this will return without doing anything, because a
  # customer with that SSN does not exist, and the
  # customer's first name is not yet known.
  # The customer is still nascent.
  customer.name.first = 'Jane'
  customer.name.last = 'Smith'
  customer.db_save()
  # Since the required columns are now defined, the customer
  # object is no longer nascent.  The record now exists in the database.
{% endhighlight %}

Note that [`db_read()`] is called every time the screen starts to
load, and [`db_save()`] is called as the screen finishes loading.  So
in many cases, you don't need to worry about calling these functions
manually.  However, you will need to call them when results change
during the processing of a screen.

It may be helpful to call [`db_read()`] in the [`validation code`] of
a [`question`].

{% highlight yaml %}
---
objects:
  - customer: Customer
---
question: |
  What is the customer's SSN?
fields:
  - SSN: customer.ssn
validation code: |
  customer.db_read()
{% endhighlight %}

Although the [`validation code`] here won't raise a
[`validation_error()`] to make the user fix something, it is code that
runs after `customer.ssn` has been defined and before the [interview
logic] is evaluated.  It "validates" the `customer` object by
populating `customer` with additional attributes from [SQL] if there
is a record in the [SQL] table where the `ssn` column is equal to
`customer.ssn`.

Instead of calling [`db_read()`], you could call [`db_save()`].  The
difference is that if you set any [Python] attributes other than
`ssn`, [`db_save()`] will overwrite the [SQL] values with the values
that exist in [Python].  By contrast, [`db_read()`] will overwrite the
[Python] values with the values that exist in [SQL].

If you call the method [`ready()`] on an object, it will try to
[`db_save()`] the object to SQL if the object is nascent.  It will
then return `False` if the object is still nascent (or if it is a
zombie), and will return `True` otherwise.

If you want to test whether a record exists in the database for a
particular `id` or unique ID, you can use the class methods
[`id_exists()`] and [`uid_exists()`].

{% highlight yaml %}
question: |
  Look up a customer by SSN
fields:
  - SSN: ssn
validation code: |
  if not Customer.uid_exists(ssn):
    validation_error("That customer does not exist")
{% endhighlight %}

In this example, the [`_uid`] of a `Customer` object is `ssn`, so the
[`uid_exists()`] class method will search the `ssn` column.

## <a name="sqlobject tables"></a>Defining tables

For help on writing table definitions, consult the [SQLAlchemy]
documentation.

Every table definition must contain a primary key called `id`.  For
example:

{% highlight python %}
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
{% endhighlight %}

[SQLAlchemy] has a feature by which you can define "relationships"
between tables.  This is not supported by the `SQLObject` feature.

Representing relationships between two objects in **docassemble** is
best done by creating a separate object that represents the
relationship itself.  While it is entirely possible in Python to write
`plaintiff.father = witness[0]` and `witness[0].child[0] = plaintiff`,
a problem arises when the user edits relationships.  If the user
changes `plaintiff.father`, then you need to make sure that the old
`plaintiff.father` is modified to remove the `witness[0].child[0]`
reference.  This is very complicated, while allowing the user to edit
the relationship object is simple because the relationship exists in
just one place.

If you don't want to use a separate table, you can represent
relationships using class attribute declarations like `bank_id =
Column(Integer, ForeignKey('bank.id', ondelete='CASCADE'))`.  In this
case, the attribute in [Python] land will simply be an integer.  You
can obtain a [Python] object from this integer using the [`by_id()`]
class method.  But note that objects returned by [`by_id()`] will have
random [`instanceName`]s.

## <a name="sqlobject classes"></a>Writing classes

When writing [`DAObject`] classes that correspond to [SQLAlchemy]
tables, you must use a [multiple inheritance] class declaration where
the first class is a [`DAObject`] class and the second class is
[`SQLObject`].

{% highlight python %}
class Bank(Person, SQLObject):
{% endhighlight %}

Note that the [`SQLObject`] is defined in the `docassemble.base.sql`
package, not in the `docassemble.base.util` package.

{% highlight python %}
from docassemble.base.sql import SQLObject
{% endhighlight %}

For a [`SQLObject`] to work, you need to define a few class attributes
and include an [`init()`] method.  Always set `_model` to the object
representing the [SQLAlchemy] table definition.  Always set `_session`
to the object you obtain by calling `sessionmaker(bind=engine)`.

You can set `_required` to a [Python list] of column names that must
be set before the object can be saved to the [SQL] table.  Until these
columns have definitions (as obtained from [`db_get()`]), the object
will remain nascent.  The default value is an empty list.

Always include an [`init()`] method that calls [`init()`] on the
parent class and then calls `sql_init()`.

{% highlight python %}
def init(self, *pargs, **kwargs):
    super().init(*pargs, **kwargs)
    self.sql_init()
{% endhighlight %}

Finally, you must define the methods [`db_get()`], [`db_set()`], and
[`db_null()`], which handle getting, setting, and undefining information
for columns.  For example, in the `Bank` class in the example, each
bank has two columns (not including the `id` column): `name` for the
name of the bank and `routing` for the routing number of the bank.

Each of these methods should contain if/else statements that perform
the necessary operations depending on what the column name is.

{% highlight python %}
def db_get(self, column):
    if column == 'name':
        return self.name.text
    elif column == 'routing':
        return self.routing
    raise Exception("Invalid column " + column)
def db_set(self, column, value):
    if column == 'name':
        self.name.text = value
    elif column == 'routing':
        self.routing = value
    else:
        raise Exception("Invalid column " + column)
def db_null(self, column):
    if column == 'name':
        del self.name.text
    elif column == 'routing':
        del self.routing
    else:
        raise Exception("Invalid column " + column)
{% endhighlight %}

As the `name` column demonstrates, a column value in [SQL] land can
correspond to the attribute of an attribute in [Python] land.  In
[Python] land, a name is a [`Name`] object, but in [SQL] land, the
name is represented as a collection of attributes.

When the [`db_get()`] and [`db_null()`] methods are called from
[`SQLObject`] code, these calls are typically wrapped in
`try`/`except`, so that if your code triggers an exception (for
example because an attribute is not defined) then the [`SQLObject`]
code will know that the column information does not exist.  You do not
need to use `try`/`except` logic of your own in these methods; just
follow the pattern above.

## <a name="sqlobject pitfalls"></a>Pitfalls

### Multiple Python objects associated with a single SQL record

When using `SQLObject`, make sure that your interview logic does not
create multiple separate Python objects associated with the same SQL
record. If you do that, then if you change the attributes of one
object, but not the other, the two objects will be in conflict with
one another. Which attributes are saved to the server will be random,
depending on which object is [pickle]d last.

The `SQLObject` maintains an object cache under the `_internal`
dictionary in the interview answers. When a `SQLObject` has an `id`, a
reference to that object will be created in the cache. Methods like
`.filter(),` `.all(),` and `.by_id()` and `.by_uid()` return
references to this cache if the object is in the cache, rather than
create new objects. The cache helps avoid the problem of multiple
separate Python objects existing in the interview answers.

### Concurrency

Between the time when the screen starts loading (when data are copied
from SQL data to Python) and the screen finishes loading (when data
are copied from Python to SQL), no lock is placed on the SQL
records. Suppose session A copies data from SQL to Python at time 0,
session B copies data from the same SQL record to Python at time 1,
session B writes changes to the SQL record at time 2, and session A
writes changes to the SQL record at time 3. In this scenario, session
A's changes would overwrite the changes that session B made.

The same result would happen if a third-party application made changes
to the SQL record instead of session B.

However, suppose session A copies data from SQL to Python at time 0,
session B copies data from the same SQL record to Python at time 1,
session B writes changes to the SQL record at time 2, and then at time
3 the interview logic of session A finishes without making any
changes. In this scenario, session A would not overwrite the changes
of session B, because from the perspective of session A, there is no
need to take the time to write data to SQL, since nothing changed.

If you expect that SQL records might be altered concurrently, using
`SQLObject`s to synchronize between interview answers and a SQL
database might not be sufficiently robust.

## <a name="sqlobject reference"></a>Reference guide

### <a name="sqlobject class attributes"></a>Class attributes

<a name="SQLObject._model"></a>The `_model` class attribute refers to a
[SQLAlchemy] class representing a [SQL] table.

<a name="SQLObject._session"></a>The `_session` class attribute refers
to a [SQLAlchemy] object representing a SQL session generator, which
can be obtained by calling `sessionmaker(bind=engine)`.

<a name="SQLObject._required"></a>The `_required` class attribute
refers to a list of strings, where each string corresponds to the name
of a class attribute of the table definition (i.e. a column in the
[SQL] table).  The [`SQLObject`] will be considered nascent until each
of these columns can be defined.  The [`SQLObject`] will not trigger
the seeking of a definition of any undefined [`DAObject`] attributes;
your [interview logic] will need to trigger the asking of the necessary
[`question`]s or running the necessary [`code`] blocks.  If you do not
specify a `_required` class attribute, the empty list will be used.

<a name="SQLObject._uid"></a>The `_uid` class attribute refers to a
string, where the string corresponds to the name of a class attribute
of the table definition (i.e. a column in the [SQL] table).  If you do
not specify a `_uid` attribute, the default value of `uid` will be
used.  If you have a column in your [SQL] table by the name of `uid`,
this will be used as the unique identifier.

### <a name="sqlobject instance attributes"></a>Instance attributes

Behind the scenes, the [`SQLObject`] code uses attributes of the
object to track the state of the object and its relationship to the
current state of the [SQL] table.

<a name="SQLObject._nascent"></a>If the object is nascent, the
`_nascent` attribute will be set to `True`.  This attribute is `True`
when the object is first initialized, and it is set to `False` when
the object acquires an [`id`].

<a name="SQLObject.id"></a>When the object is connected with the [SQL]
table, the `id` attribute is set to the integer ID of the record in
the SQL table.

<a name="SQLObject._zombie"></a>If the object has an [`id`] but there
is no corresponding `id` in the [SQL] table, the `_zombie` attribute
is set to `True`.  This can happen if the object in [Python] land
still exists after the underlying record in the [SQL] table is
deleted.  You should probably avoid this.  Instead of deleting records
from [SQL], you could use a boolean column called `active` that is set
to `False` when the record should no longer be used.

<a name="SQLObject._session"></a>When you need to run [SQLAlchemy]
commands, use the `_session` attribute to access the [SQLAlchemy]
session object.

### <a name="sqlobject instance methods"></a>Instance methods

<a name="SQLObject.db_get"></a>The `db_get()` method is called by
[`SQLObject`] code when it needs to read information from [Python]
land for purposes of populating column values in [SQL] land.  The
first and only positional parameter is the name of the column.  The
method should return the value from [Python] land that corresponds
with the given column name.

<a name="SQLObject.db_set"></a>The `db_set()` method is called by
[`SQLObject`] code when it needs to populate information in [Python]
land based on the values in a row in a [SQL] table.  The two
positional parameters are the column name and a data value.  Based on
the column name, the method should write information to the
appropriate place in [Python] land.

<a name="SQLObject.db_null"></a>The `db_null()` method is called by
[`SQLObject`] code when a value in a record is null for a particular
column.  In the example code above, `db_null()` calls `del` on the
object attribute corresponding with the column.  You may wish to
implement this by setting the value to `None`.  When stored in SQL, a
`None` value will become a null value.

{% highlight python %}
    def db_null(self, column):
        if column == 'spouse':
            self.spouse = None
        elif ...
{% endhighlight %}

Then the attribute will be defined for [Python] purposes; referencing
it in your interview will not result in the asking of a question.

Alternatively, you may want to handle this differently depending on
whether the attribute was already defined in [Python].  For example,
if your interview had asked the user for a value, but then later the
value was nulled in the SQL database, you might not want your
interview to ask the same question again.  In that case you could
write:

{% highlight python %}
    def db_null(self, column):
        if column == 'spouse':
            if hasattr(self, 'spouse'):
                self.spouse = None
        elif ...
{% endhighlight %}

That way, the `spouse` attribute will remain undefined in [Python]
land and null in [SQL] land until you give it a value in [Python]
land.  Then if it is later nulled in [SQL] land it will become `None`
in [Python] land.

<a name="SQLObject.db_find_existing"></a>If you are using a [`_uid`]
in your [`DAObject`] class definition, you don't need to specify a
`db_find_existing()` method.  The example above of the `BankCustomer`
class demonstrates a situation where a `db_find_existing()` method is
appropriate.  The return value should either be `None` or a
[SQLAlchemy] row record.

<a name="SQLObject.save_if_nascent"></a>The `save_if_nascent()` method
runs [`db_save()`] if [`_nascent`] is `True`.

<a name="SQLObject.ready"></a>The `ready()` method returns `True` if
the object is connected to a [SQL] record.  It will first try to
connect the object to a [SQL] record if it can.  Internally, this
method runs `save_if_nascent()` and then returns `True` if the object
is neither nascent nor a zombie.

<a name="SQLObject.db_save"></a>The `db_save()` method tries to save
a [Python] object to [SQL].  If there is no SQL record yet, it will
create one if the "required" information is present.  If there is an
existing SQL record, the values of the columns will be overwritten
with the information from [Python] if it is different.

<a name="SQLObject.db_read"></a>The `db_read()` method tries to update
the [Python] object with information from [SQL].  If the object is
nascent, but there is enough information in [Python] to connect the
object with a [SQL] record, the [Python] information will be updated
from [SQL] and the object will be marked as non-nascent.  If the
object is already non-nascent, but no record can be found in [SQL],
the object is marked as a zombie.

<a name="SQLObject.db_delete"></a>The `db_delete()` method deletes the
underlying record from the database and marks the object as a zombie.

<a name="SQLObject.sql_init"></a>The `sql_init()` method needs to be
called from the [`init()`] method of each class after the call to
[`init()`] on the parent class.

### <a name="sqlobject class methods"></a>Class methods

<a name="SQLObject.by_id"></a>If you have the `id` of a [SQL] record
and you want to obtain a [Python] object corresponding to that ID,
you can call the `by_id()` class method.  If your class name is `Customer`,
and the id is `customer_id`, you would call `Customer.by_id(customer_id)`,
and the result would be a `Customer` object.  If an object for this `id`
is already present in the interview answers, that object will be
returned.  If the object does not already exist, a new object will be
returned, and its [`instanceName`] will be random.  If no object could
be found, `None` is returned.

<a name="SQLObject.by_uid"></a>The `by_uid()` method is similar to
`by_id()`, except it uses the column indicated by [`_uid`] instead of
the `id` column.  If there is no [`_uid`] column in the underlying
table, `None` is returned.

<a name="SQLObject.id_exists"></a>If you want to know whether an
object exists in [SQL] based on its `id`, you can call the
`id_exists()` class method.  If your class name is `Customer`, and the
id is `customer_id`, you would call `Customer.id_exists(customer_id)`.
The result will be `True` if a record exists in SQL, and `False`
otherwise.

<a name="SQLObject.uid_exists"></a>The `uid_exists()` class method is
similar to `id_exists()`, except it uses the column indicated by
[`_uid`] instead of the `id` column.  If there is no [`_uid`] column
in the underlying table, `False` is returned.

<a name="SQLObject.delete_by_id"></a>If you know the `id` of a row in
a [SQL] table and you want to delete that row, call `delete_by_id()`
with the `id` you want to delete.

<a name="SQLObject.delete_by_uid"></a>The `delete_by_uid()` class
method is similar to the `delete_by_id()` class method, except it uses
the `_uid` of the table rather than the `id`.
