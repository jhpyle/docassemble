If you would like to contribute to the **docassemble** project, the
most impactful thing you can do is use the software.  You are also
encouraged to participate in the [Slack] group and contribute bug
reports and feature requests.

If you would like to help fix bugs, pull requests on GitHub are
welcome.

If you would like to contribute code for new features, the best
practice is to first write your features as an [add-on package] and
let the community know about it on [Slack].  If it makes sense to make
the feature part of core **docassemble**, it can be moved into the
core.

If you would like to contribute money, note that **docassemble** is
not an entity and is not sponsored by any entity, so it is not
possible to fund the development of **docassemble** directly.
However, you are welcome to [make a financial contribution] to the
[Merlin Legal Open Source Foundation], which is a non-profit that
supports the cause of free and open-source software in the legal
field.
