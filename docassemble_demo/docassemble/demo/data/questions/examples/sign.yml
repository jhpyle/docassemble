question: |
  Collect an electronic signature
subquestion: |
  If you provide your e-mail address and upload a document,
  you can get a link that you can give to someone, where
  they can click the link, sign their name, and then the
  signed document will be e-mailed to you.

  The document you upload needs to be in .docx format.

  In the place where you want the signature to be, you need to
  include the word "signature" surrounded by double curly brackets.
  For example:

  > I swear that the above is true and correct.
  >
  > {{ signature }}
  >
  > Angela Washington

  If you do not include "{{ signature }}" in exactly this way,
  a signature will not be inserted.
