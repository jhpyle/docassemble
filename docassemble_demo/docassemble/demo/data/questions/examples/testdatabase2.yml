# This is the block that defines customer.bank based on "customer.bank_id",
# which is a string that comes from the combobox. The string may be an integer
# ID of an existing bank or a text name of a new bank. If the user wants to create
# a new bank, this block will cause the "customer.bank_routing_number" question to
# be asked.
# Regardless of whether the user is picking an existing bank or a new bank, this
# block will always define customer.bank as an object with an instanceName like banks[23]
# where 23 is the database ID of the bank.
