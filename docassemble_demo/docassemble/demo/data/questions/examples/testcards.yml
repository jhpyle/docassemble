      ${ card_start("The real truth about apples", color="danger", icon="apple-alt") }
      We would advise you to stop eating
      apples immediately. Apples are produced
      by a [conglomerate] that is secretly
      owned by the teachers union, and they
      are trying to brainwash your kids
      into buying apples in order to enrich
      themselves.
