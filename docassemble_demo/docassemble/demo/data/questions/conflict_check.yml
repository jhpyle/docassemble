  Welcome! 
subquestion: |
  Welcome to the Law Office of James Ryland Miller, PLLC's automated interview 
  for Conflict Checks.  At the end of the interview, you will have
  
  1. a chance to review your answers before submitting to the law office; and
  
  1. a chance to download a copy of the document that will be 
     sent to the law office for your records. 
     
  However, if you make a mistake, **you will have to start over from the beginning**
  or you will **have to back up to your mistake**. 
     
  If you do not complete the entire interview, no information will be sent to the law
  office. The interview software will conclude with a message stating if the
  information has been successfully sent. 
  
  I'm going to ask you some questions to see if a conflict of interest exists. 
  If a conflict exists, we may not be able to help you. Some conflicts can be handled
  by disclosure and agreements; however, not all conflicts can be handled that
  way. 
  
  Please note: **you should not send confidential information at this time**. If the 
  law office determines that no conflict exists, then the law office may send
  initial consult paperwork that will then ask for confidential information.

question: | 
  No Attorney Client Relationship
subquestion: |
  Do you understand that by using this interview, no attorney-client
  relationship is being formed? 
under: |
  This means that neither the Law Office of James Ryland Miller, 
  PLLC nor any of its attorneys are *your* attorney at this time. 
  The law office only takes legal action or renders legal advice
  *after* both lawyer and client sign a written fee agreement. 
  This interview does not count as such a written fee agreement.

question: | 
  Duty to Report Child Abuse
subquestion: |
  Do you understand that the law office and its attorneys have an 
  affirmative duty to report child abuse to the government? 
under: |
  In Texas, certain professionals are required by law to report
  child abuse or suspected child abuse to the government within
  a certain time period. Texas attorneys are even required to 
  violate attorney-client privilege to report this information.

  While this office does not currently practice family law nor
  criminal law; it still has the same duty to report child abuse.
yesno: understand_dutyreport
---
question: No Attorney Client Privilege
subquestion: |
  Do you understand that your answers to this interview are not 
  protected by the attorney-client privilege? 
under: |
  This means that you should not reply with information that is 
  confidential until an attorney-client relationship is formed
  by a written agreement signed by both lawyer and client.
