include:
  - basic-questions.yml
comment: |
  This loads some question definitions that are common to many legal
  interviews.  It also defines basic variables like "user" and sets
  the names of icons that you can use to "decorate" your questions.

  The "basic-questions.yml" comes from the docassemble.base package
  and is located in the directory docassemble/base/data/questions.

  You can include question files from other packages by explicitly
  referring to their package names.  E.g.,
  "docassemble.helloworld:questions.yml" refers to the file
  questions.yml in the docassemble/helloworld/data/questions
  directory.

comment: |
  An "image sets" block defines the names of icons that you can use to
  "decorate" your questions.  Loading the "basic-questions.yml" file
  already defined a number of icons, but this block defines some more
  icons.

  Since this file, questions.yml, is in the docassemble.demo package,
  the image files referenced here are also in the docassemble.demo
  package.  The files are located in the directory
  docassemble/demo/data/static.

  Since most free icons available on the internet require attribution,
  the "image sets" block allows you to specify what attribution text
  to use for particular icons.  The web app shows the appropriate
  attribution text at the bottom of any page that uses one of the
  icons.

auto terms:
  rhododendron: |
     A genus of shrubs or small trees, often having handsome
     evergreen leaves, and remarkable for the beauty of their
     flowers.
  custody order: |
    An order signed by a family court judge that says who gets to have
    what kind of custody over a child.
  complaint: |
    A document that you file in court to start a lawsuit.
  lawyer: |
    Someone with a license to practice law.
  plaintiff: |
    The person who starts a case.
  defendant: |
    The person who is on the defensive in a case.  In a lawsuit, the
    plaintiff sues the defendant.
comment: |
  Sometimes you will use vocabulary that the user may or may not know.
  Instead of interrupting the flow of your questions to define every
  term, you can define certain vocabulary words, and docassemble will
  turn them into hyperlinks wherever they appear.  When the user
  clicks on the hyperlink, a popup appears with the word's definition.

  This is the code that directs the flow of the interview.  It

  "client_done."  There is a question elsewhere that "sets" the variable
  "client_done."  Docassemble will ask all the questions necessary to
  get the information need to pose that that final question to the
  user.

  However, if the answer to the question
  user_understands_no_attorney_client_relationship is not
  "understands," the interview will looks for a question that sets the
  variable "client_kicked_out."

  This is an example of a multiple-choice question that runs Python
  code (as opposed to simply setting the value of a single variable).

  This example also shows how you can create square buttons with icons

  This is an example of how docassemble can serve as an "expert

  You can embed raw HTML into a list of fields using the 'html' key.
  You can also expand the capabilities of what you do with this HTML by
  adding 'script' and 'css' keys.

  The text of 'script' is added to the bottom of the page, while the
  text of 'css' is added to the <head>.

  Note that you can use Mako templates in each of these declarations.

  if dateutil.parser.parse(injury_date) > cutoff_date:
      statute_of_limitations_ok = True
  else:
      statute_of_limitations_ok = False
comment: |
  This code uses some Python functions to determine whether the date
  of the injury is within the statute of limitations period.

  The variable cutoff_date represents the latest date in the past when
  an injury could have occurred that would still be actionable under
  the statute of limitations.  To calculate cutoff_date, we start with
  today's date and subtract a number of number of years given by the
  applicable statute of limitations.  The number of years in the
  applicable statute of limitations period is the number stored in the
  variable statute_of_limitations_years.

  In Python, we calculate cutoff_date using the subtraction operator,
  the minus sign, which does special things when the variables
  involved are dates and intervals.  The call to
  "datetime.datetime.now()" returns today's date and time as a date
  object.  The call to "relativedelta()" returns a time interval
  object where the length of the interval is number of years given by
  statute_of_limitations_years.  Today's date "minus" that interval
  gives the date in the past we are looking for.

  This code relies on the special Python modules datetime,
  dateutil.relativedelta, and dateutil.parser.  We could have used an
  "import" block to import these modules.  If we did that, the Python
  "import" command would be run every time a question is asked in the
  interview.  There may be a slight efficiency boost to importing
  module names into the namespace only when and if they are necessary.

  - note: |
      How would you describe the general *milieu* of ${ x.possessive('abode') }?
  - no label: x.address.milieu
    required: False
comment: |
  In this question, the type of home uses a "radio" selector.  The
  address type will be set to one of "Apartment," "Leased house,"
  "Owned house," or "Mobile home."  Because "shuffle" is true, the
  order of the choices will be random (different every time the page
  is loaded).

  The "amenities" of the home, by contrast, use a "checkbox" selector.
  This means that the variable will be defined as a Python dictionary
  containing two key/value pairs, not as text.  For example, if this
  question is asked regarding an Individual with the variable name
  "client," and the user selects "Chimney" only, the value of
  client.address.amenities will be a Python dictionary in which
  "chimney" is set to True and "stove" is set to False.

  The "amenities" field also demonstrates that checkbox values and
  labels can be set using Python code.  The code needs to evaluate to
  a Python dictionary, where the values are the labels to be shown to
  the user and the keys are the keys that will be used in the
  resulting Python dictionary (x.address.amenities).

  The third "field" is not really a field; it is a "note."  This
  places text onto the screen.  The text can include Markdown and can
  be a Mako template.  In this case, the text introduces the fourth
  field, which is a text field with no label.  Since the label has the
  special value "no label," the field fills the width of the form.

comment: |
  This question demonstrates fields that have the style of dropdown
  lists.  The values of a dropdown list can be generated with code
  that runs at the time the question is asked, or they can be
  hard-coded into the question itself.  The code here gets a list of
  U.S. states from a helpful Python module called "us."  Note that we
  imported this module earlier.

comment: |
  docassemble uses the Mako templating system to expand variables
  within Markdown text.  Mako allows functions to be defined within
  source text using "def" constructs.  If you write Mako "def"
  functions, you may want to use them in more than one document.  This
  section shows how you can attach a name (e.g., kid_defs) to some
  Mako text, and an example below shows how an attachment can include
  this Mako text by referring to it by its name (kid_defs).

  Another way to write functions in docassemble is to write methods
  that act on docassemble objects, which you define in your objects.py
  file within your package.

comment: |
  The following question is the interview's main endpoint.  This
  question has two attachment documents.  Most of the questions in the
  interview are asked because they are needed by this question or one
  of its attachments.

  This section demonstrates use of the "need" clause to gather
  information about the case's plaintiffs and defendants up front.
  This is not strictly necessary, because the case caption will cause
  those questions to be answered.  However, the "need" clause forces
  docassemble to gather the information up front, before it starts
  processing the question and its attachments.  This helps to direct
  the order of the questions in a more sensible fashion.
