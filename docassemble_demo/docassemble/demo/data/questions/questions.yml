  An "interview help" block adds text to the "Help" page of every
  question in the interview.  If the question has help text of its
  own, the "interview help" will appear after the question-specific
  help.

  This help screen displays different text depending on whether the
  web interface or the SMS interface is being used.

include:
  - basic-questions.yml
comment: |
  This loads some question definitions that are common to many legal
  interviews.  It also defines basic variables like "user" and sets
  the names of icons that you can use to "decorate" your questions.

  The "basic-questions.yml" comes from the docassemble.base package
  and is located in the directory docassemble/base/data/questions
  in that package.

  You can include question files from other packages by explicitly
  referring to their package names.  For example,
  "docassemble.helloworld:questions.yml" refers to the file
  questions.yml in the docassemble/helloworld/data/questions
  directory of the docassemble.helloworld package.

comment: |
  An "image sets" block defines the names of icons that you can use to
  "decorate" your questions.  Loading the "basic-questions.yml" file
  already defined a number of icons, but this block defines some more
  icons.

  Since most free icons available on the internet require attribution,
  the "image sets" block allows you to specify what attribution text
  to use for particular icons.  The web app shows the appropriate
  attribution text at the bottom of any page that uses one of the
  icons.
  
  Since this file, questions.yml, is in the docassemble.demo package,
  the image files referenced here are also in the docassemble.demo
  package.  The files are located in the directory
  docassemble/demo/data/static.

  In a later question we will refer to the variable "village_idiot."
  This "objects" block creates the variable "village_idiot" and

  lawyer: |
    Someone with a license to practice law.
  plaintiff: |
    The person who starts a case.
  defendant: |
    The person who is on the defensive in a case.  In a lawsuit, the
    plaintiff sues the defendant.
comment: |
  Sometimes you will use vocabulary that the user may or may not know.
  Instead of interrupting the flow of your questions to define every
  term, you can define certain vocabulary words, and docassemble will
  turn them into hyperlinks wherever they appear.  When the user
  clicks on the hyperlink, a popup appears with the word's definition.

mandatory: True
code: |
  client.asset.new('checking account', 'savings account', 'stocks and bonds', 'automobiles')
  client.asset.gathered = True
  client.income.new('employment', 'self employment', 'SSI', 'TANF', 'rent', period=12)
  client.income.gathered = True
comment: |
  This interview will ask whether the client has particular income and assets.

  The objects client.asset and client.income are docassemble objects that function
  like Python "dictionaries."
  
  This code initializes the list of income and asset items.

  The attribute "gathered" is set to True because after being initialized with
  the given items, we want the list to be considered complete.  That is, we
  do not want the interview to ask the user if there are any additional items
  to add.
  
  "Mandatory" sections like this one are evaluated in the order they
  appear in the question file.
---
initial: True
code: |
  set_language(user.language)
comment: |
  When providing interviews in multiple languages, you need to tell docassemble
  what language it should use for the built-in words and expressions
  that the user will see.  This needs to be set up-front in "initial" code, which
  will run every time the screen loads.

  When the interview first loads, user.language is undefined.  Therefore
  docassemble will ask the user a question in order to obtain a definition for
  user.language.  We will encounter this question below.
  
  "Mandatory" and "initial" sections are evaluated in the order they
  appear in the question file.  But "mandatory" sections are different because
  as soon as they run to completion, they will subsequently be skipped.
  "Initial" sections will always be run every time the screen loads.
---
mandatory: True
code: |
  need(user_saw_initial_screen)
  if user_understands_no_attorney_client_relationship == "understands":
    need(client_done)
  else:
    need(client_kicked_out)
comment: |
  This is the code that directs the flow of the interview.

  It runs after the user's language is set by the previous "initial" block.

  Note that there are no other "mandatory" or "initial" questions in the
  interview.  This code block determines how the interview will end.
  
  This code indicates to the system that we need to get to the
  endpoint "client_done."  There is a question elsewhere that contains
  "event: client_done."  Docassemble will ask all the questions
  necessary to get the information need to pose that that final
  question to the user.

  However, if the answer to the question
  user_understands_no_attorney_client_relationship is not
  "understands," the interview will looks for a question that sets the
  variable "client_kicked_out."  There is a question elsewhere that
  contains "event: client_kicked_out."

  This is the code that determines the entire path of the interview,
  and yet it is very short, even though the interview has many questions.
  That is because interview flow in docassemble is automatic.  The order
  in which questions are asked can vary depending on the user input.  In
  some interviews, a question is asked early, and in another, it is asked
  later.  Questions are asked if and when there is a necessity to
  gather information.

  There is one additional bit of the interview flow that is manual: the
  requirement of "user_saw_initial_screen."  This causes a "welcome" screen
  to be shown.  We always want this screen to be displayed first (at
  least as soon as we determine the user's language).

code: |

    case.plaintiff.append(client)
  if client not in case.defendant.elements and not client.is_plaintiff and client.is_defendant:
    case.defendant.append(client)
  case.plaintiff.there_are_any = True
  case.defendant.there_are_any = True
comment: |
  This interview relates to a court case.  It takes advantage of the
  basic-questions.yml file in the docassemble.base package.  This
  interview file provides some functionality for legal interviews.

  For example, basic-questions.yml defines the objects "case" and "client."

  But in our interview, what do we want to do with "case" and "client"?
  What is the relation of the client to the case?  Is the client the user,
  or a different person from the user?

  The purpose of the above code is to set initial values for the
  objects case.plaintiff and case.defendant.  These objects are
  docassemble objects that function as Python lists.  They represent
  the plaintiffs and defendants in the case.

  This code will add the client as a plaintiff, or add the client as a
  defendant, depending on whether the client is a plaintiff or a
  defendant.  This code will trigger the asking of questions to
  determine whether the client is a plaintiff or a defendant, if those
  facts are unknown.  Elsewhere there is a question that defines the
  "is_plaintiff" attribute and another question that defines the
  "is_defendant" attribute.

  The end result of this code is to define the "there_are_any"
  attributes of the two lists.  Note that this code is not
  "mandatory."  It will be run when and if the interview needs to know
  whether the lists are empty.  We set the attributes to True because
  all court cases need to have at least one plaintiff and at least one
  defendant.

comment: |
  This is an endpoint question (note that the only options are exiting
  or restarting).

  If the interview was configured to show a progress bar, the progress
  bar would be set to 100% on this question.

  This question uses the "event" directive.  "client_kicked_out" is a
  variable, just like any other variable, except that it is never
  defined, only sought.

  We saw above in the "mandatory" code block that if the user does not
  understand that no attorney-client relationship will be created, the
  "client_kicked_out" variable will be sought.  When that variable is
  sought, this question will be displayed to the user.

  This question also uses a "decoration."  This places an icon in the
  corner of the screen.  The image by the name of "exit" is defined
  in the basic-questions.yml file.

  The following interview is designed to demonstrate almost all of
  **docassemble**'s features.  At the end, you will be provided with a
  fake client letter and a fake pleading.

  question is available.

  Click "Source" to toggle the display of the [YAML] code used to
  generate the question.  (Note: the "Source" tab is available because
  this server is configured as a development server; end users would

  This is the "splash screen" for the interview.  The question is a

generic object: Individual
question: |
  What language ${ x.do_question('speak') }?
field: x.language
choices:
  - English: en
  - Español: es
default: ${ language_from_browser() }
comment: |
  This is the first question that will be asked because there is
  an "initial" block above that needs the definition of user.language.

  This is a "generic object" question.  It is written in a "generic"
  way so that it will ask "What language do you speak?" or "What language
  does John Smith speak?" depending on whether "x" is the user or not.

  The language_from_browser() function sets the default choice to
  English or Spanish if the web server detects that the user's browser
  is set to either of these languages.  This method of determining the
  user's language is not 100% reliable, but it will save the user from
  making an extra click.

question: |
  ${ x.do_question('have', capitalize=True) } a support order?

  then you have a support order.

yesno: x.has_support_order
comment: |
  This question illustrates how you can include images in your
  questions.  The file sample-support-order.jpg is stored in the
  docassemble.demo package in the subdirectory
  docassemble/demo/data/static.  This is how you refer to a "static"
  file that exists within a docassemble subpackage.

  The "100%" indicates that the image width should fill the screen.

comment: |
  This is an example of a multiple-choice question that runs Python
  code (as opposed to simply setting the value of a single variable).

  This example also shows how you can create square buttons with icons
  and labels: you just add an "image" value to the button item.

code: |
  if client_has_injury and injury_in_jurisdiction and \
     statute_of_limitations_ok:
    client_has_standing = True
  else:
    client_has_standing = False
comment: |
  This is an example of how docassemble can serve as a legal "expert
  system."  The variable "client_has_standing" (a legal concept) can
  be set using simple logical expressions in Python.  Legal concepts
  can be expressed as true/false variables and the law can be coded in
  logical expressions like these.

  Note that the "\" character at the end of a line is merely a
  formatting aid.  Python normally considers line breaks to indicate
  that a statement is finished.  The "\" character at the end of a
  line tells Python that the statement isn't finished yet.

comment: |
  This question demonstrates the use of objects in a multiple choice
  question, as well as the feature of disabling fields when they are
  not necessary.  The question allows the user to indicate who the
  "village_idiot" is.  If the village idiot is a plaintiff or
  defendant, the user will be able to select the person's name from a
  list.  If the village idiot is not a plaintiff or defendant, the
  user can enter the person's name.  Either way, village_idiot will be
  an object.

comment: |
  You can embed raw HTML into a list of fields using the 'html' key.
  You can also expand the capabilities of what you do with this HTML by
  adding 'script' and 'css' keys.

  The text of 'script' is added to the bottom of the page, while the
  text of 'css' is added to the <head>.

  Note that you can use Mako templates in each of these declarations.

code: |
  court.jurisdiction = ['US', 'state', 'PA', 'trial', 'Philadelphia County']
  jurisdiction_state = "Pennsylvania"
  jurisdiction_county = "Philadelphia"
comment: |
  This code sets some information about the current jurisdiction.  The
  interview assumes that the legal case is in a Pennsylvania court.

  The court.jurisdiction variable uses a special format that is
  particular to the docassemble.base.legal module.  It is used to
  facilitate the use of "layers" of code, where there is a common
  layer of questions and code applicable at a federal level, another
  layer of questions and code applicable at a state level, another
  layer of questions and code applicable at a county level, etc.

  Note that this code is not "mandatory."  It will be called when and
  if the interview needs to know any of these variables.

  if as_datetime(injury_date) > cutoff_date:
      statute_of_limitations_ok = True
  else:
      statute_of_limitations_ok = False
comment: |
  This code uses some date/time functions to determine whether the
  date of the injury is within the statute of limitations period.

  The variable cutoff_date represents the latest date in the past when
  an injury could have occurred that would still be actionable under
  the statute of limitations.

  To calculate cutoff_date, we start with today's date and subtract a
  number of number of years given by the applicable statute of
  limitations.

  The number of years in the applicable statute of limitations period
  is the number stored in the variable statute_of_limitations_years.

  What is ${ x.possessive('home') } like?
fields:
  - Type of home: x.address.type
    datatype: radio

      - Apartment
      - Leased house
      - Owned house
      - Mobile home

      {u'chimney': u'Chimney', 'stove': 'Stove'}
  - note: |
      How would you describe the general *milieu* of ${ x.possessive('abode') }?
  - no label: x.address.milieu
    required: False
comment: |
  In this question, the type of home uses a "radio" selector.  The
  address type will be set to one of "Apartment," "Leased house,"
  "Owned house," or "Mobile home."  Because "shuffle" is true, the
  order of the choices will be random (different every time the page
  is loaded).

  The "amenities" of the home, by contrast, use a "checkbox" selector.
  This means that the variable will be defined not as text, but as a
  Python dictionary containing key/value pairs.  For example, if
  this question is asked regarding an Individual with the variable
  name "client," and the user selects "Chimney" only, the value of
  client.address.amenities will be a Python dictionary in which
  "chimney" is set to True and "stove" is set to False.

  The "amenities" field demonstrates that checkbox values and labels
  can be set using Python code.  The code needs to evaluate to a
  Python dictionary, where the values are the labels to be shown to
  the user and the keys are the keys that will be used in the
  resulting Python dictionary (x.address.amenities).

  The third "field" is not really a field; it is a "note."  This
  places text onto the screen.  The text can include Markdown and can
  be a Mako template.  In this case, the text introduces the fourth
  field, which is a text field with no label.  Since the label has the
  special value "no label," the field fills the width of the form.

comment: |
  This question demonstrates fields that have the style of dropdown
  lists.  The values of a dropdown list can be generated with code
  that runs at the time the question is asked, or they can be
  hard-coded into the question itself.  In this case, we use the
  states_list() function to provide a list of U.S. states.

comment: |
  docassemble uses the Mako templating system to expand variables
  within Markdown text.  Mako allows functions to be defined within
  source text using "def" constructs.  If you write Mako "def"
  functions, you may want to use them in more than one document.  This
  section shows how you can attach a name (e.g., kid_defs) to some
  Mako text, and an example below shows how an attachment can include
  this Mako text by referring to it by its name (kid_defs).

  Another way to write functions in docassemble is to write methods
  that act on docassemble objects, which you define in your objects.py
  file within your package.

comment: |
  This very long question is the interview's main endpoint (it offers
  to define client_done, which was referred to in the mandatory code
  block above.  This question has two "attachment" documents.  Most of
  the questions in the interview are asked because they are needed by
  this question or one of its attachments.

  This question also demonstrates use of the "need" directive to
  gather information about the case's plaintiffs and defendants up
  front.  This is not strictly necessary, because the case caption
  will cause those questions to be answered.  However, the "need"
  clause forces docassemble to gather the information up front, before
  it starts processing the question and its attachments.  This helps
  to direct the order of the questions in a more sensible fashion.

  fall back to using the available English versions of each question.)

comment: |
  This demonstration interview is not available in Spanish, but this
  question and the question after it demonstrate how multi-lingual
  interviews can be constructed.  This question offers to set
  "user_saw_initial_screen," just like a previous question block did,
  except that this question has a "language: es" directive, indicating
  that this question should only be used if the current language (as
  set by the "initial" code block above using the set_language()
  function) is Spanish.

  This demonstrates how vocabulary terms can be provided in a
  language other than the default language.

question: |
  What is ${ x.possessive('gender') }?
field: x.gender
choices:
  - "Male :male:": male
  - "Female :female:": female
  - Other: other
comment: |
  You can include "emoji-style" images by putting colons around an
  image name (as defined in an "images" block).  This feature works
  within labels as well as within question text.

generic object: Individual
question: |
  How much ${ x.do_question("make") } from ${ i }?
fields:
  - Amount: x.income[i].value
    datatype: currency
  - "": x.income[i].period
    datatype: number
    code: |
      period_list()
comment: |
  If you do not want a field to be labeled, you can use "" as the
  label name.

  The function period_list() provides a list of options (12 for "Per
  Month," 1 for "Per Year," and 52 for "Per Week").

  The datatype "currency" is like the datatype "number" except that
  causes the input field to be displayed with a locale-specific
  currency symbol.

generic object: Individual
question: |
  How much ${ x.do_question("make") } from employment?
decoration: bills
fields:
  - Employment Income: x.income['employment'].value
    datatype: currency
  - "": x.income['employment'].period
    datatype: number
    code: |
      period_list()
comment: |
  The previous question was a general question; this is a specific
  question that asks the question a certain way if the income type is
  "employment."  Although this question and the previous question are
  both capable of defining x.income['employment'].value, this one
  takes precedence because it is more specific.

  The following questions are also specific cases.  The decorations
  are different for each question.
---

question: |
  How much ${ x.do_question("make") } from self-employment?

question: |
  ${ x.do_question("have", capitalize=True) } income from ${ i }?
yesno: x.income[i].exists
comment: |
  This question and the following questions ask the threshold question
  of whether the income or assets is applicable.  If it does not
  "exist," there is no need to ask for its value.
---
generic object: Individual
question: |
  What kinds of income ${ x.do_question("have") }?

fields:
  - Employment: x.income['employment'].exists

  - SSI: x.income['SSI'].exists
    datatype: yesnowide
  - Cash assistance: x.income['TANF'].exists
    datatype: yesnowide
comment: |
  The datatype "yesnowide" is just like the data type "yesno" except
  that it fills the width of the form rather than aligning with other
  fields that use labels.
