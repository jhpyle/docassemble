  this name in the [Interview List].

  The **Short title** is the name that mobile users will see in the
  upper-left corner of the screen.  It should be very short.

question: |
  Wizard for a simple document assembly interview
subquestion: |
  This wizard will create a **docassemble** interview that assembles
  one or more documents for the user.

  It will ask you to upload at least one document template.

  You can upload Microsoft Word .docx template files in which variable
  names are embedded in double curly brackets ([Jinja2 syntax]).  For
  example, if your .docx document contains the text:

  > My phone number is {{ phone_number }} and I live in {{ city }}.

  then the wizard will build a **docassemble** interview that gathers
  definitions of the variables `phone_number` and `city` in order to
  create the assembled document.

  Here is a [sample Word file] you can use as a starting point.
  
  You can also upload PDF files containing fillable fields.  The
  names of the fields will be converted to variable names.
  
  You can also upload templates in [Markdown] format that contain
  variables embedded using [Mako syntax]:

      Your phone number is ${ '${ phone_number }' } and you live in ${ '${ city }' }.

  Regardless of what file format you use, the files you upload will be
  saved in the [Templates section] of the [Playground].  If the
  template file you want to use is already in the [Templates section],
  you do not need to upload it again unless you want to upload a new
  version.
  
  Once your interview has been created, it will be available in the
  [Playground], where you can edit it.

  This wizard is primarily a tool to help new interview authors learn
  how to write **docassemble** interviews.  There are many features in
  **docassemble** that are not available with this wizard.

  an error

  Please fix the errors, click the Back button, and
