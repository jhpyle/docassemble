## [0.5.105] - 2020-02-26
### Changed
- If the database is PostgreSQL, the Alembic table alteration
  introduced in 0.5.97 for MySQL compatibility purposes is no longer
  applied by default because it might take too much time on a server
  with a large SQL database.  The discrepancy between the SQLAlchemy
  column type specification (varchar) and the actual PostgreSQL column
  types (text) is harmless.  If your SQL database is not large, you
  can set `force text to varchar upgrade: True` in your Configuration
  before upgrading to force the column type alteration to take place
  during the upgrade.  After upgrading to 0.5.105+, you can remove
  `force text to varchar upgrade` from the Configuration.  This is
  only applicable if upgrading from 0.5.96 or before; if you already
  upgraded to 0.5.97 - 0.5.104, then the alteration has already taken
  place.

  Configuration.

  code.

  used as a literal `group_id`.  Rather, an argument `'fruit'` it will
  be converted into a group_id of the form
  `docassemble.packagename:data/sources/ml-interviewname.json:fruit`.
  You can still set a literal `group_id` using the keyword parameter
  `group_id`.
- When an `initial_file` is given to a `MachineLearner` object, two
  different formats can be used: an array, or a dictionary of arrays.
  If a dictionary of arrays, the keys will be checked and if the key
  matches the `group_id` (with the part before the final
  colon, if any, removed), the array corresponding to that key will be
  used.
