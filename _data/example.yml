  \ from this time and place,\n      to friend and foe alike, that\n      the torch\
  \ has been passed to\n      a new generation of\n      Americans [ENDASH] born in\
  \ this\n      century, tempered by war,\n      disciplined by a hard and\n     \

  \      no failure of substance. We are\n      stricken by no plague of locusts.\n\

  \      I come before you tonight as a\n      candidate for the Vice Presidency\n\
  \      and as a man whose honesty\n      and -- and integrity has been\n      questioned.\n\
  \n      Now, the usual political thing\n      to do when charges are made\n    \
  \  against you is to either ignore\n      them or to deny them without\n      giving\
  \ details. I believe we've\n      had enough of that in the\n      United States,\
  \ particularly with\n      the present Administration in\n      Washington, D.C.\
  \ To me the\n      office of the Vice Presidency\n      of the United States is\
  \ a great\n      office, and I feel that the\n      people have got to have\n  \
  \    confidence in the integrity\n      of the men who run for that\n      office\
